	<div class="posttitle" style="opacity: 0.6;"><small>June 11, 2016</small></div>
</div>
<div class="wikitext"><p><a href="/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ToolsEmail">My current email tooling</a> is strongly built around
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MH_Message_Handling_System">MH</a>,
using both command line tools and <a href="http://beedub.com/exmh/">exmh</a>.
MH assumes a traditional Unix mail environment where your inbox can
be accessed through the filesystem, and more than that it fundamentally
assumes that it entirely owns your email. As many people who try
it out find out to their regret, MH's only interaction with the
regular Unix mail ecosystem is to get your mail out of your Unix
inbox as fast as possible.</p>

<p>So far I've been able to use and keep on using MH because I've
worked (<a href="/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/UniversitySysadminEmailMistake">and had my personal email</a>)
on Unix systems that handled email in the traditional Unix way,
with your inbox directly accessible through the filesystem in
<code>/var/mail</code> and so on. However, these are a vanishing breed, for
reasonably good reasons, and in the modern world the generic way
you get at your email is IMAP.  IMAP is not very Unixy, but it's
what we've got and it's better than being stuck with proprietary
network mail protocols.</p>

<p>MH and IMAP not so much don't get along as don't interact with each
other. As far as I know, MH has no protocol support for IMAP, which
is not surprising; IMAP is designed to keep all of your email on
the IMAP server, which is completely opposite to how MH operates.
It might be nice to have an 'IMH' system that was a collection of
command line programs to manipulate IMAP mail and folders, but no
such thing exists that I know of and it's unlikely that anyone will
ever write one.</p>

<p>Some day I will have to use a mail system that can only be accessed
over IMAP. In theory I could deal with this by using a program to
pull all of my email out of IMAP and hand it over to MH as local
mail; there are a number of things that will do variants of this
job. In practice my feeling is that doing this is swimming upstream
against a pretty powerful current, and thus generally a mistake.
Certainly I expect that I won't be energetic and annoyed enough to
do it. By that point MH will have had an extremely good multi-decade
run for me, and very few programs last forever. I can change.</p>

<p>(Also, by that point I expect that I will be really tired of how
MH and exmh don't really deal all that well with HTML email, because
I expect that HTML email is only going to get more and more common
from now onwards.)</p>

<p>PS: The clever reader will have guessed that I don't currently have
a smartphone or other limited secondary device that I want to read
my email from, because all of those really want you to use IMAP (or
something even less MH-cooperative, like GMail). <a href="/~cks/space/blog/tech/SmartphoneGPSSpreadForMe">That may change
someday</a>, at which point I may
have to re-think all of this.</p>

<h3>Sidebar: I don't see this happening any time soon</h3>

<p>Locally we're still very strongly attached to filesystem accessible
inboxes and <code>procmail</code> and all of the other artifacts of a traditional
Unix mail system. There would be quite a lot of upset users if we
took that away from them, so I don't expect it to happen short of
something truly drastic happening with our overall mail system.</p>

<p>(Nor is the department likely to give up running its own email
system any time soon.)</p>

<p>As for my personal email, well, <a href="/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/UniversitySysadminEmailMistake">that's tangled</a> but certainly my attachment to MH
complicates my life. There are lots of places that I could get IMAP
mail, probably even IMAP mail for a custom domain, so if I was happy
with IMAP alone life would be quite a bit easier. Until I de-tangle
my personal email it gets a free ride on work email's MH friendliness;
after I de-tangle it, I will probably still run my own servers for
it and so I could run MH there if I wanted to.</p>

<p>(At that point I might want to switch to IMAP for various reasons.)</p>
