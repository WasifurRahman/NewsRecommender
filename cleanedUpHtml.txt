Anushka Sharma is in Delhi for the final schedule of her upcoming film Sultan wherein she will be seen romancing Salman Khan. The actress, who will also be playing the role of a wrestler along with Dabagg actor, seems to be enjoying some quality time with her crew members.
Earlier this week, the team of Sultan headed out for dinner in the capital city. Anushkas picture of enjoying a scrumptious boat full of sushi has been doing the rounds. She sure had the best time during the shoot of the film. (Read:Salman Khan flaunts his dusty chiseled body in the new still of Sultan, see pic)

Though Salman Khan goes missing from the dinner party pics, which were posted on Twitter by YRF Talent, we assume the busy man to be working on his other projects meantime.
The first teaser of the film was recently released by Salman Khan were he is seen in a langot (loins cloth) fighting his opponents and flaunting his physique.
Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, Sultan will release this Eid.
