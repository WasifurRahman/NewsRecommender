Article:
Seventeen billionaires just declared that they fully expect end their lives a lot poorer, but the world may wind up far richer for it.
That's the number of new signatories who've committed to the Giving Pledge, an annual oath launched in 2010 by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates in which billionaires publicly promise to give more than half their wealth to charitable causes. The catch: It has to happen either within their lifetime or in their will. The point is to try to make an impact quickly, rather than start a foundation that continues in perpetuity.
The full list of new Giving Pledge members:
Margaret and Sylvan Adams (Israel)
HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz AlSaud (Saudi Arabia)
Marc and Lynne Benioff (U.S.)
Nathan and Elizabeth Blecharczyk (U.S.)
Brian Chesky (U.S.)
Scott Cook and Signe Ostby (U.S.)
Jack and Laura Dangermond (U.S.)
Henry Engelhardt, CBE and Diane Briere de l'Isle-Engelhardt, OBE (UK)
Joe Gebbia (U.S.)
Sir Tom and Lady Marion Hunger (UK)
Robert and Arlene Kogod (U.S.)
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (India)
PNC and Sobha Menon (UAE)
Gary K. Michelson, M.D. (U.S.)
Gensheng Niu (China)
Liz Simons and Mark Heising (U.S.)
Dr. Herbert and Nicole Wertheim (U.S.)
After six years or recruiting, the Giving Pledge's total class now consists of 154 people from 16 countries. Each inductee chooses their own cause, something they probably could have done on their own. That is, if they were smart enough to execute it. On the flip side, signing the pledge gives each billionaire access perhaps the world's most exclusive boardroom. As Gates puts it in his press release, the communal goal is to give in a "bold and effective" way. "Melinda, Warren and I are glad to have the opportunity to learn with them and learn from them," he says.
For instance, this is a crew that holds an annual conference to share ideas on solving issues other than their designated pet problems. This year's topics included re-thinking how to empower women in the global economy, fix the environment, spur urban renewal, and fund scientific game-changers. In other words no one's splurging here. Why make it rain just once when you can spend your largess wisely, creating social good that can actually scale?
To that end, this year's list marks a couple of firsts. It's the first time that representatives from Saudi Arabia (Saudi prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud) and China (dairy magnate Gensheng Niu) have climbed aboard. Because of the esteem that comes with joining up, it's safe to say that those representations could be considered establishing a foothold in a new market. And leveraging Chinese power for the greater good could have an especially big return. That country has the second most billionaires after the U.S. (The current ledger: America 540, China 251. But add up who's earning big in the entire Asia-Pacific region, and their stack of golden wallets would quickly dwarf ours.) So far, there's little danger of the GivingPledge running out of potential candidates. Per Forbes, the world has minted more than 1,800 billionaires.
Leveraging Chinese power for the greater good could have an especially big return. That country has the second most billionaires after the U.S.
This is also the first year that one company's entire founding team has signed on at the same time. (Unless you count 2010 when Paul Allen signed the pledge right after Gates started it.) That honor belongs to Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk. (You can read the bios of all 17 of the new signatories here).
In a way, the Airbnb signups seem representative of the sort cultural shift that Warren, Bill and Melinda were probably seeking. GivingPledgers certainly join at all ages and from across all industries. (The oldest, banker David Rockefeller is 100.) Still, there seems to be a movement afoot. A couple of years ago, a couple of hip Groupon execs signed the pledge in close succession. Then came Facebook alum Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, along with Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna.
Turns out, it's okay to be building a company while giving away a substantial amount of what you're taking home. The payoff is that you can afford to save the world while you're still living in it.

Article:
Artists frequently claim their latest work is more "real" or "raw" than anything they've done before. It's become such a clich that we were skeptical when Alicia Keys described her forthcoming album as the most honest and uncensored yet. But the singer's recent story in Lenny Letter shows she's walking the walk. She explains how the pressure for perfection has affected her over the years:
"Every time I left the house, I would be worried if I didn't put on makeup: What if someone wanted a picture?? What if they POSTED it??? These were the insecure, superficial, but honest thoughts I was thinking. And all of it, one way or another, was based too much on what other people thought of me."
That led to Keys promoting her new single "In Common" with a makeup-free photo:
Keys hopes her #NoMakeup photo will inspire others, but it's about more than beauty productsshe also wants to address our impulse to cover up:"I don't want to cover up anymore. Not my face, not my mind, not my soul, not my thoughts, not my dreams, not my struggles, not my emotional growth. Nothing."

Step inside a tanning salon and you'll see government-mandated signs calling out health risks: premature aging, skin cancer, and eye damagejust to name a few. Still, a 2014 study by JAMA Dermatology showed 35 percent of adults and 59 percent of university students in the United States have been indoor tanning.
Even if you don't go regularly, you may have used a tanning bed once or twice to get a base tan before vacation. The assumption is that base tans reduce burns by increasing melanin, the pigment that protects you from UV damage and is responsible for skin tone. But that protection is minimal. "Having a tan does mean that your skin has increased melanin, but the added protection is equivalent to an SPF of 3 to 4," Nazanin Saedi, M.D. of Thomas Jefferson University, says.
Getting a base tan before you go on vacation is the equivalent of smoking a pack of cigarettes before you go into a coal mine.
In fact, base tans just cause more harm. "Getting a base tan before you go on vacation is the equivalent of smoking a pack of cigarettes before going into a coal mine," J. Scott Kasteler, M.D., says. "All you're doing is adding to the damage."
The takeaway? Embrace your pasty shade and use sunscreen. If you're sold on the bronzed look, Saedi suggests sticking to spray tans. Above all, remember that there's no such thing as a healthy tan. "Any kind of tan is the body's response to the skin being damaged," Saedi says.

Well be the first to admit weve gone a little cuckoo for kombucha. But as much as we love the fermented drink, we may need to rein in our enthusiasm for itand similar gut-friendly goodies. As this video from The Atlantic points out, there's not enough scientific evidence to actually support the probiotic craze. What we do know is this: A high-fiber, minimally processed diet is your best bet for a healthy gut. Bacteria thrive on the fiber found in whole foods, and fiber transforms into short-chain fatty acids, which help regulate the immune and digestive systems.
So go ahead and keep sippin small-batch kombucha if you like the taste, but you may want to hold off on probiotic pills until researchers find a kind that improves gut health in scientific studies.

Article:
Earlier this year, the popular veterans organization, Wounded Warrior Project, was rocked by a series of bad press. An investigation by The New York Times found that while the organization was raising an impressive $372 million in donations each year, a big chunk of that money wasn't going to veterans. Instead, the top executives were shelling out nearly 40% of their annual revenues to indulge business-class travel, expensive hotel stays, fanciful employee conferences, and their own exorbitant salaries.
While the Wounded Warrior Project's expenses were laughably tone-deaf, the affair highlights a major issue in the world of nonprofit funding: When foundations or individuals donate to an organization, they often expect their money is going to triage the issueproviding clean water, feeding childrenand not to paying for office space or corporate retreats for nonprofit workers. To solve this, most foundations pay only up to 15% of any socially good group's indirect costs, things like office space, salaries, or equipment.

But a new report from Bridgespan, a consulting firm for nonprofits and philanthropists, says this is incredibly damaging. The result is a "starvation cycle" in which foundations are crippling the outfits they're trying to support. In the commercial world, investors have come to expect that companies in different spaces require different overhead. There is no boilerplate expense sheet. That's a lesson nonprofit funders have failed to learn.
"What you need to invest in as a nonprofit depends on what you are doing," says Jeri Eckhart-Queenan, the lead author on the report. "A number of foundations have these flat-rate policies where they treat all nonprofits the same. That is the big ah-ha, here. We've had a very failed understanding of what it takes to get the job done."
The fix: Bridgespan is calling for a new era of "Pay-What-It-Takes" philanthropyin essence, that grant makers need to figure out what amount of indirect costs per mission are normal, then pony up and pay them.
So far, the strategy has at least one major ally. In January, Ford Foundation president Darren Walker promised to increase grant money earmarked for indirect costs to 20%, doubling their previous standard. He's called the previous funding threshold a "charade" and the "overhead fiction."
This is especially important at a time when some nonprofits appear to be struggling to understand even their own finances. According to a recent report by Oliver Wyman and Seachange Capital Partners only 30% of New York nonprofits can be considered "financially strong"and "many trustees do not understand the financial condition of their organization or how it compares to its peers."

IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM
Bridgespan has warned that nonprofits were being shortchanged this way before. That "starvation cycle" terminology dates back to 2009, when the firm pointed out that research by the Urban Institute's National Center for Charitable Statistics and Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University showed many NPOs with revenues over $100,000 still suffered from broken computers, untrained staff, and janky office furniture.
Part of the problem is that many funders have become obsessed with measuring their impact on a per-dollar basis, which means they're more eager to give to specific projects than the institutional upkeep that supports them. But the 15% overhead limit doesn't even parallel what commercial companies shell out. According to Bridgespan's research, the average S&P 500 firm spends about 34% of their budget on essential behind-the-scenes support. For IT companies it's more like 78%, the report notes. Some 21st-century nonprofits probably require the same kind of tech firepower.
In a survey of 20 high-profile nonprofits, Bridgespan found that indirect coststhose that don't go to programs or services, including fundraisingranged from 21% to 89% of each group's overall spending. To splice that data a more telling way, Bridgespan divided the nonprofit industry into four main sectors: U.S.-based direct service, policy and advocacy organizations, international networks, and research organizations.
How money gets spent by Save the Children would be drastically different than, say, the biohazard laboratory required at the Center for Infectious Disease Research. (One probably needs more counter space and test tubes.) So Bridgespan then divided each industry's expenses into a series of categories: administrative expenses, network and field costs, physical assets and knowledge management. Many agencies opted to share data anonymously, but, by sector, there were strong similarities.
Bridgespan's takeaways: "Flat-rate reimbursement for indirect costs is conceptually wrong because it doesn't take into account the differences by segment," the report notes. And the given nonprofit reimbursement rate of 15% is definitely too low. "It doesn't represent the actual indirect costs it takes to run any of the nonprofits we analyzed."
SO WHAT'S THE FIX?
Let's start with the wrong way to solve this issue. In the Bridgespan report, one anonymous CEO noted that his or her group kept two budgets "one that has the real numbers, and another that shows the funders what they want to see." Another strategy might be to steal from one budget line item to cover for the shortfall in another. Such financial brinkmanship is fatally flawed, says study author Eckhart-Queenan, because it reinforces the idea that overhead is "a proxy for effectiveness or efficiency and it's neither." As Save the Children has learned, sometimes the back-end budget doesn't have any wiggle room. Because their indirects costs aren't fully covered, the group ends up having to cover the deficit with between $12 to $18 million of their "unrestricted funding" funds annually, the report notes.
Change may not happen immediately. But Bridgespan's report at least provides some basis for re-thinking what's broken. "To our knowledge, this is the first time that anyone has suggested there might be a different rule of thumb [for funding] by types of nonprofit," Eckhart-Queenan says. No doubt, the next generation of Silicon Valley do-gooders entering this field will understand what it takes to run a companyany company. Perhaps it's time for more grantmakers like Ford to audit their own behavior.
For nonprofits needing a crash course in indirect cost calculation, Bridgespan offers a tool here.

Article:
The easing of Californias drought has boosted the states early spring hydropower generation to its highest level since 2011, helping it to recover from a 15-year low reached last year. But hydroelectricity production is not expected to improve much overall this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The Wests four-year drought desiccated many reservoirs in California, the nations fourth largest hydropower producer, reducing their ability to generate electricity and forcing the state to rely on other renewables and more fossil fuels for its power supply.

Prior to the drought, hydropower produced nearly 40 percent of the states electricity during wet years, with natural gas producing most of the rest. Today, about 11 percent of the states electricity comes from hydropower and 52 percent comes from natural gas, with wind, solar and nuclear producing much of the rest.
Though hydropower generated at large reservoirs is not included in Californias climate goals, it is a major source of renewable electricity that helps offset the countrys reliance on coal for electricity.
California passed a law last year requiring 50 percent of the states power to come from wind, solar, biomass, geothermal energy and small hydroelectric sources by 2050.

Since the drought began in 2012, Californians burned an additional $2 billion worth of natural gas to make up for lost hydropower, increasing greenhouse gas emissions from the states electric power sector by 10 percent, said water and climate analyst Peter Gleick, president of the Oakland-based Pacific Institute, a global water think tank.
Californias hydropower boost follows El Nio-fueled storms, which marched across the state over the winter, helping to fill some reservoirs to above their historical averages, state data show.
Tim Shear, an economist at the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said the states hydropower production in March 2.77 million megawatt hours was the highest of any March since 2011.
(Your browser doesn't support iframe)Hydropower generation usually peaks each summer when reservoirs are swollen with snowmelt and rainfall. The 2015 peak occurred in July at about 1.9 million megawatt hours, the lowest annual peak since 2001.
Nearly-full reservoirs point to more hydropower generation for the short term, but it may not continue through through the summer.
Though the U.S. Climate Prediction Centers seasonal outlook shows that California is likely to receive average rainfall this summer, warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected, which will help evaporate water stored in hydroelectric reservoirs.
Gleick said he expects that Californias hydropower generation will recover only marginally this year.
Northern California received about an average amount of rainfall, but the reservoirs were extremely low and so less than an average amount of water was let go through the turbines, he said. I would estimate that 2015-2016 will be below average (for) hydropower again, though certainly better than last year.

The sweeping reefs growing off 200 steamy miles of remote Australian coastline
from Cairns to Cape Melville, home to sugar farms and dive resorts
contained some of the least damaged corals growing in one of the worlds best marine parks. Until now.
In stunning new findings that have laid bare the limitations of marine parks as defenses against rapid environmental change, more than half of the corals surveyed in large chunks of this pristine stretch of the Great Barrier Reef are expected to soon be dead.Seaweed beginning to blanket dying coral along a heavily impacted stretch of the Great Barrier Reef.

Reefs that are in better shape should fare better under climate change, said John Pandolfi, a University of Queensland professor who contributed to high-profile coral surveys, the results of which were released this week. But, in this case, we found huge instances of coral mortality.
The coral deaths followed intense coral bleaching, which was caused by global warming and influenced by the whims of the weather. Hot waters have caused corals worldwide to spit out the algae that provided their color and food. Those that cant cool down and find new algae quickly enough die.

The colorless coral corpses of north Queensland will soon be blanketed with mats of algae, and the hard skeletons will begin to crumble. It may take decades for the submerged wonders of what had recently been unspoiled reefs to resprout and recover from the wipeout,if they ever do.
Temperatures continue to rise worldwide. The amount of heat-trapping pollution released every year from fuel burning and deforestation has plateaued in recent years, while the amount of pollution in the atmosphere continues to pile up. Bleaching is caused primarily by warm waters, and the current worldwide bleaching is the third and worst on record, all since the late 1990s.
Things arent going to be as good as they are now
we can look forward to some very difficult times, Pandolfi said. The reef is going to continue to degrade.Credit:ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies
Overall, 35 percent of the corals surveyed in the central and northern sections of the Great Barrier Reef were reported this week to be dead or dying. Scientists photographed and dove into 84 reefs and used six categories to score the condition of 200,000 corals. Dead corals could often be spotted by the algae that quickly grew over them.
The news from coral surveys south of the popular tourist city of Cairns was bleak, with about 5 percent of corals found dead or dying. But that was some 10 times better than the doom that befell reefs further north.
Corals south of Cairns appear to have been saved by the happenstance trajectory of a February cyclone, which washed them with cooler waters and churned up the sea. That protected them from the high temperatures and searing exposure to UV rays that killed so many of their cousins further north.
We dodged a bullet in the central portion of the reef this time, but no guarantees that will occur again, Pandolfi said. Nature is an incredibly complex place, and its very difficult to predict how future bleaching might play out.
The discovery of the collapse of sweeping sections of corals was viewed by scientists with so much urgency that they were not put through peer review before highlights were released to the media on Monday. James Cook University, which led the surveys, declined to provide detailed information about the sampling methods or analysis, making it difficult for journalists or other scientists to evaluate or interpret the findings.
The research is publicly funded, James Cook professor Terry Hughes said. I released our mortality results because, as a scientist, Im ethically obliged to inform people on an issue of national and international importance.Hughes said details about the methodology would eventually be published. Given the intensity of the research, there'll be many publications arising.
David Kline, a Scripps ecologist who wasnt involved with the coral surveys, said that he had complete confidence in the findings. Survey methods are pretty standardized, he said. They havent changed much in the last 30 or 40 years.
Emotions had been running high even before Mondays news release over the future of one of the worlds great natural wonders amid a two-year period of rapid global warming. Climate change made it 175 times more likely that Coral Sea temperatures would reach the high levels in March that triggered extensive bleaching, according to the results of a recent scientific analysis.
Climate research and Great Barrier Reef management are both hot political issues in Australia, where a federal election will be held next month.
The Australian government has been criticized for failing to protect the reef from agricultural pollution and other threats, including coal mining. Following a request from Australia, the United Nationsrecently removed informationabout threats to the Great Barrier Reef from a report dealing with climate change and world heritage.
The north Queensland coral wipeout occurred around the same time that global temperature rise was reaching the halfway point toward the 3.6F of warming that a new United Nations treaty aims to prevent. Countries havent yet committed under the Paris Agreement to take the steps needed to prevent that level of warming. Years of further negotiations are planned.Viewed across a river from Cooktown, part of the remote Queensland coastline along which coral mortality rates were highest.

The extent of the coral wipeout was particularly remarkable because it occurred inside one of the worlds best protected natural areas. Fishing restrictions and other rules are in place to protect reefs that serve as nurseries for large fisheries and as drawing cards for a tourism-heavy economy.
The coral animal is the keystone species on a coral reef
like the trees in a forest, Kline said. When the corals die you lose the three-dimensional structure thats really important. A lot of these fish, their larval stages depend on hiding in among the corals to hide from predators.
Kline said the Great Barrier Reef is inside whats considered to be one of the best managed and most successful marine parks in the world.
Large marine parks have been created around the world in rapid succession during the last decade, quadrupling the amount of protected ocean to nearly 4 percent. The U.N. aims to see 10 percent protected by 2020.
In other parts of the world, weve had mortality events this severe, Kline said. But everyone thought with the Great Barrier Reef marine protected area that, hopefully, we wouldnt see mortality events as high.
Kline said that means the future of coral reef environments will depend on local strategies for protecting them
in addition to a global curbing of greenhouse gas pollution. Such strategies may include farming and transplanting corals and creating artificial reefs from concrete and other material.
Clearly, marine reserves on their own arent enough, Kline said.

Article:
We know foam rolling (a form of self-myofascial release or self-massage) boasts big benefits such as easing muscle soreness and aiding recovery.1 But the foam roller's round, unstable design also makes it a useful tool for challenging your balance and building strength. Doing a plank on the roller or balancing your feet on it creates instability for strength-based movements, which causes you to engage more muscles to stabilize and will, in turn, make you stronger, says Joselynne Boschen, Nike Master trainer.
We rounded up the 15 best strength moves you can do with a foam roller. Warm up by rolling out some commonly tight spots, then get down to business, focusing on keeping your core engaged and stabilized throughout. Ready to roll?
How to Use This List
Create your own workout: Pick 2 moves from each section below (upper body, lower body, and core), then do Plank Jacks as the 7th move for cardio. Do 10 to 20 reps of each move. Repeat the full circuit a total of 3 or 4 times.
Try ours: Follow Boschen's workout at the end of this list.
Upper Body1. Overhead Squat
Stand with feet turned out, slightly wider than hip width. Extend arms overhead while holding roller horizontally. Squeeze palms toward each other as you draw shoulder blades together. Keep elbows in line with or behind ears to engage upper back and arms. Send hips back to sit into a deep squat. Press up through heels to return to starting position.2. Side Rollout Push-Up
Start in a modified push-up position with knees on mat, left hand on roller, and right hand on floor. Slowly lower weight with right arm as left arm stays straight and roller works its way from fingertips to wrist.
Make it harder: Lift knees to a traditional push-up position.3. Table Roll
Sit upright with legs extended and ankles on foam roller. Place hands on floor behind you, fingertips facing feet. With straight legs, thrust hips up as high as you can and look toward ceiling as roller moves up calves. Keeping hips lifted, slowly swing them back between arms as roller moves to heels. Continue going back and forth in a controlled movement without letting hips touch floor.
Make it easier: Turn fingertips away from you.4. Plank Jack
Start in plank position with hands on roller directly under shoulders. Hop feet open and closed as you would for a jumping jack, staying on toes. Keep a slight bend in knees as you land.
Make it harder: Increase speed and intensity to engage core more.5. Airplane
Stand on both feet and hold roller behind back with fingertips facing away. Transfer weight onto right leg and lift left leg into an airplane position (or warrior III for yogis) as chest hinges forward. Squeeze shoulder blades together and away from ears. Pulse the roller up about 3 inches toward ceiling. Keep arms as straight as possible to activate triceps, delts, and lats.
Lower Body6. Hamstring Bridge
Lie faceup with palms facing down and foam roller under feet. Lift hips into a bridge position so hips, knees, and heels are in line. With control, slowly rock foam roller forward and backward. Engage hamstrings to keep roller from slipping.
Make it harder: Place palms on ground facing up.7. Plank Leg Lift
Start on all fours with hands on roller. Lift knees to plank position and engage core. Raise right leg about 4 inches, then sweep foot out to the right, pause for 1 count, sweep leg back behind you, and lower to the floor. (Think: up, out, in, down.)8. Single Leg Wall Squat
Lean against wall and sit so knees are at a 90-degree angle. Place roller horizontally behind back, just below shoulder blades, and extend both arms. Raise right flexed foot off ground, keeping knees in line and hips level. Push through left heel to stand about 3 inches, using roller to slide up wall, then return to starting position. Repeat on other side.9. Inner Thigh Bridge
Lie faceup with knees bent, feet on floor, and palms up. Place foam roller between legs and flex feet to balance on heels. Lift hips off floor and squeeze roller like you're trying to break it. Hold for 45 seconds then lower back down.10. Inner Thigh Plank
Lie facedown with roller between inner thighs. Press up into a high plank. With weight over wrists and core engaged, squeeze roller and bend knees until they hover an inch off the ground. Press back into heels to return to starting position. Keep core engaged and still throughout.

Lie faceup with roller vertically under spine. Place fingertips on floor as you lift legs into tabletop position. Holding the 90-degree angle, tap heel to floor one at a time.
Make it harder: Tap heels faster and keep lower abs firing by pressing low back into roller.12. Sawing Plank
Start with wrists on foam roller in a forearm plank with hands clasped together, feet hip width, and hips level. Use arms to rock back and forth slowly so roller moves from wrists to elbows, challenging your stability.13. Side Plank Reach Through
Lie on right side. Place feet on roller like you're on a tight rope with right foot in front. Lift hips to a side plank, balancing on right forearm and sides of feet, and extend left arm to ceiling. Thread left arm under torso as you pike hips. (Imagine a claw pulling hips straight up.)14. Walking Plank
Place roller vertically between arms and legs while you hold a high plank. Make sure shoulders are over wrists and feet are wider than hips for stability. Place right hand then left hand on roller and walk hands back to floor one at a time. Alternate the hand you start with and the hand you place in front of the other on the roller. Keep core engaged and hips steady throughout.
Make it easier: Put a towel alongside the roller to keep it from moving15. Dead Bug
Lie faceup with roller vertically under spine. Lift legs into tabletop position. Place arms on floor in cactus position (elbows bent in line with shoulders, backs of hands on floor). As you press backs of hands into the floor and lower back into the roller, kick legs out, then bend knees to return to tabletop.Special thanks to Joselynne Boschen, Nike Master trainer and Lifesum brand ambassador, who curated and modeled these moves for us.

Article:
If you live in Seattle and want to help some of the 4,500 people living on the streets, here's a new way: You can make a donation at WeCount, a new service that matches the needs of the homeless with the spare resources of a local community.
Founders Jonathan Sposato and Graham Pruss liken WeCount to platforms like Airbnb or Lyft, except the goods and services on offer aren't vacations or taxi rides, but rather sleeping bags and tents. The homeless list items they need while members of the public list items to donate. The platform then links up the two sides, arranging delivery, and allowing donors and donees to stay in touch if they wish.
"One advantage here is that it's completely painless," says Sposato, a tech entrepreneur who's sold two companies to Google. "It's super easy for me to engage in activity where I can be helpful for someone whereas traditional giving is a little less personal. You don't get a sense of really impacting a specific individual."
WeCount, a nonprofit, is partnered with the City of Seattle's Human Services Department, and groups like Union Gospel Mission, Facing Homelessness, and the local YMCA. It has 25 branded drop-off points in the Seattle area where the homeless can pick up donated items. They're all from a prescribed list of 200 items ranging from socks to clothes for an interview. You can't donate money directly to individuals, though WeCount itself plans to accept money for its own upkeep.
Last year, Seattle's mayor declared homelessness in the city to be an "emergency." But Pruss, who has worked for several homelessness nonprofits, says the problem isn't necessarily a lack of resourcesit's as much a failure to distribute those resources more effectively.
"While there is a huge amount of need, there is actually a huge amount of services and a lot of people who want to help. Often there's a disconnect in communication as individuals haven't been able to express what truly would be able to help them," he says.
Pruss hopes that when the homeless use WeCount, they'll find out about other opportunities available, whether it's permanent housing or job training. "We hope we can get it beyond the, 'How do we get the things that improve this person's life to tonight?' to 'How do we improve their lives tomorrow?'" he says.
