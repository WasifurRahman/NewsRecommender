School board declines to approve Crum as SHS boys basketball coach...
Pleas from three parents Monday night werent enough to sway the minds of Springfield School Board members to retain Mike Grossen as principal at Springfield High School.The board unanimously approved all of the recommendations in a shuffle of administrators proposed by School Superintendent Jennifer Gill.Grossen, who will take over next school year at Addams Elementary School, will be replaced by Lisa Leardi, an assistant principal at Lanphier High School.The decision to move Grossen, Springfield High's principal since 2011, was the only administrator move that met with opposition Monday.However, in a surprising move, the board rejected hiring Joby Crum as the new head boys basketball coach at Springfield High. Adam Lopez, Judy Johnson, Chuck Flamini and Blake Handley all voted "present" on the Crum hire, meaning he didn't get enough "yes" votes from the seven-member board.Lopez, the board president, during the meeting cited concerns with how the hiring process was handled, but declined to elaborate afterward.Before the board voted on Gill's personnel moves, members heard from Lori and Jeff Butler, along with Frank Kopecky. All three have had children at Springfield High during Grossens tenure.Lori Butler praised Grossen for his support of the fine-arts program and work spearheading a new athletic practice field on New Street. Jeff Butler called Grossen a great leader.He bleeds red and black, Jeff Butler said of Grossen, referring to the school's colors.
I cannot imagine SHS being better off without Mr. Grossen as principal.Kopecky told the board he'd had four children pass through the school, and he believes Grossen is the best ambassador Springfield High has ever had.The board didnt debate the Grossen transfer, but several members said it was a tough decision because they liked him as a person.He is a hard-working individual, board member Judy Johnson said of Grossen. But I know the superintendent has had a conversation with him, and in this case, Im going to go along with the decision.After the meeting, Gill stuck by her decision, saying she believes Grossen has done a good job, but she believes a change will benefit the school.Oftentimes bringing in a fresh perspective helps a school grow and maintain excellence and take it to another level, she said.Other personnel changes approved Monday:* Washington Middle School principal Chris Barham replaces Leardi as an assistant principal at Lanphier.* Lanphier assistant principal Jonnell Baskett is moving to Iles Elementary School, where her position will be gifted and support administrator.Page 2 of 2 - * Jill Grove
longtime principal at the Early Learning Center, the district's preschool
heads to the district office, where her title is coordinator of culture and leadership.* Erica Filipiak, a principal's assistant at Feitshans Elementary School, replaces Chris Colgren, who resigned as Feitshans principal.* Addams principal Jennifer Hanson moves to Lindsay Elementary. She replaces Crum, who stepped down as principal to take a teaching position at Springfield High.* Graham principal Kim Siltman is the new coordinator of pre-kindergarten programs at the Early Learning Center.* Vincent Turner, assistant principal at Grant Middle School, will be new principal at Washington Middle School.
