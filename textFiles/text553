I have so many shared memories with you as as well :) I will always remember your positive,warm and caring heart as well as you always having the rad bikes and epic rood parties
:) . You and your family will remain in my prayers. Our family is what keeps our fire burning and our spirits light and hopeful. May your family find the love and condolences I share with our SCAD family as gratitude and support for our fellow teammate and brother. You will certainly be missed, rest peacefully. Love,

JK was my neighbor when I first moved to downtown Savannah. He once asked if their music was too loud, and I told him no and asked if mine was. He loved that. Funny guy, fun guy. I am devastated. My thoughts and my heart go out to his parents, family and friends.

Although I was not Jonathan's coach at SCAD his positive nature and team first attitude are legendary amongst the team.
I enjoyed getting to know him as a fellow coach on deck in Savannah and I am keeping Jonathan, his family, friends and teammates in my prayers.

Jk, all the times we have chatted had been met with smiles and catching up about the camaraderie between my brother and yourself and the spirit of the SCAD swim team. I always looked up to JK's humble-being, dedication and hard work ethic I had seen over many years. Everyone who has had the chance is lucky to have met JK.

As teammates we share a special bond. One of both camaraderie and friendship. We are grateful we got to have this bond with JK. He was a great friend and someone we all loved. JK will be sorely missed. We are so sorry for the loss of this wonderful person.
