Trust Benefits From FA Community Shield Fund Distribution
Posted:
Tue 03 May 2016
Trust Receives Cheque For 2,000
Blackpool FC Community Trust was presented with a cheque for 2,000 on Saturday, as part of the FA Community Shield Fund distribution.
A section of the fund is distributed by The Football Association and split evenly between the 124 clubs competing in the FA Cup 2015/16 (First Round Proper onwards) for them to donate.
The club donated its share of the fund to the Trust to support its projects across Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre.
The 2015 Community Shield contribution to the fund amounted to 40 per cent of the total match income, from general admission ticket income net of match expenses to profits from the sale of the match programme.
Outside of each clubs individual donation, the remainder of the fund will be donated to The FAs Charity Partners, Breast Cancer Care, The Bobby Moore Fund, The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation and Homeless Football Association.
Blackpool FC Community Trust:
Blackpool FC Community Trust is a vibrant and forward thinking charity, providing a range of opportunities for people in Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre to increase social inclusion and education; improve physical fitness and health; and lessen involvement in negative activities and anti social behaviour.
Projects are delivered in primary and secondary schools, local colleges, with local community groups, and within local wards. Children as young as five years old are targeted as well as groups of over 55s. Sessions take place with families, people with disabilities, and women and girls groups.
All projects are funded externally through a number of different streams, including the Football League Trust, Premier League Community Fund, Sport England, Big Lottery, Football Foundation, local housing associations, NHS Blackpool and local councils to name a few.
Blackpool FC Community Trust works very closely with the other major organisations in Blackpool, including NHS Blackpool Clinical Commissioning Group, Blackpool Council and Blackpool Football Club, as part of the Altogether Now
a legacy for Blackpool campaign, which looks to bring organisations together, to reach common goals in a more productive and joined up way.
