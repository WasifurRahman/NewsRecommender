This year Julie Gaukrodger is not only taking part in a half-marathon, she is also taking part in no fewer than SIX triathlons.
And her hard work and commitment to fitness has earned her the title of this years Member Of The Year, at Ribby Hall Village Health Club.Julie has been a member of the Wrea Green-based health club for nearly 20 years, and trains there an average five or six days of the week.
The 52-year-old human resources worker, who works for BAE Systems, says she was delighted to be given the top award.
Julie, from Kirkham, regularly takes part in swimming, spinning and Metabolic Effect classes, outdoor running, Tri (triathlon) Club and personal training sessions at the club.She says she enjoys being a member at Ribby Hall: I like the variety of classes, the friendly atmosphere, and the Tri training, in particular. And being able to have personal training, balanced with attending the group fitness classes. I like the way the instructors set you goals and encourage you to participate in events outside of the health club, for example the London Triathlon!
This year its the Great North Run and six triathlons
which I wouldnt have ever done without the motivation of my trainer, Kev.
Ive lost 2st through taking part in all this activity. And its really increased my stamina and given more self confidence, which has benefited my career at BAE Systems.I felt very honoured to be named Member of the Year. I have had really fantastic feedback from members, friends and colleagues. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend to anyone
take a class or try something you havent tried before.
With the help and encouragement of the staff and other members at the health club, anything is possible.
Ribby Halls member of the year reward and recognition incentive scheme has been running for almost seven years. Each month, members and staff at Ribby are encouraged to nominate a member of the month, who wins a meal for two at Ribby Hall Villages Restaurant. All members of the month for a particular year are then pooled, the health club management team collectively selects a winner for Member of the Year.James Mitchell, duty manager at the health club at Ribby Hall, said: Julie has been a member of the health club here at Ribby Hall Village for 19 years.
Recently, Julie has completed 11 triathlons, two half marathons and numerous 5k and 10k races. Not only has Julie lost weight, but her self-confidence has grown and grown, with the encouragement from her fellow members and her personal trainer Kevin Ward. Julie should be really proud of what shes already achieved and is an inspiration to others wanting to set themselves a fitness goal.
