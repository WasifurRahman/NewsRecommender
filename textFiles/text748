The Bloomington City Council voted Monday to allow a medical marijuana dispensary to open in the city.
Minnesota-Medical Solutions is allowed to open at 5200 84th St. W.
In January, the council approved a one-year ban on medical cannabis facilities while it studied the issue.
The council approved an ordinance in October that set standards and definitions for medical marijuana.
Bloomington Planning Commission members approved the plan in April.
Minnesota-Medical Solutions is one of two facilities operating in Minnesota. It already has centers in Rochester and Minneapolis.
The Minnesota Legislature approved limited distribution and use of medical marijuana in 2014.
Patients who fit the state guidelines would be able to obtain medical marijuana from the Bloomington facility with a doctor's prescription.
