Four Exmoor ponies will spend the summer grazing the heathland at Trinity Hill, Axminster.The animals, which arrived in April, are on loan from the RSPB in Aylesbeare, which look after the them during the winter. Countryside ranger, Nathan Robinson said: Livestock has been used throughout history as an essential component of heathland management. Selectively grazing vegetation helps to create a variety of ecological niches with diverse wildlife.After the success of grazing the site last year, we are hoping to cover a larger patch of land this year. The visiting ponies were popular with members of the public and many families explored Trinity Hill as a result of them being there.The ponies will be fenced off to ensure public safety and the grazing areas have been designed so that they do not obstruct pathways. The public can observe the ponies as they graze, but are reminded that dogs must be kept under close control.
