Re: at&t Gigapower leads broadband race...I guess it's more of a teaser headline if he's talking only about Atlanta. But it is boneheaded. He says " If all goes well in Atlanta, I expect [Comcast] to expand to other markets." That ignores what's been done with their 2 Gbps FTTH service, and their well-documented plans to roll it out in other markets where Comcast faces GigaPower. Whether he "expects it to expand" is irrelevant since Comcast has already explained its strategy, but he seems to put a lot of stock in his own opinion.Today 51 minutes ago::

Goodlatte (R-Va.) and John Conyers (D-Mich.) In comcasts pocket/On the takeNow we know where all that "donation" money is going for Comcrack and who's on the TAKE for big cable. Hey Conyers, maybe you should spend more time worrying about Detroit and Flint and let the FCC do it's job. Trust me, they don't NEED you or Goodlatte's help. It would be a good idea if the both of you also did some google'ng and see how owning your OWN cable modem didn't cause the sky to fall as big cable tried to make it out to be back in the 90's. Yeah, remember that?
With attitudes like this, it's no wonder we have to pay for the video, pay for little devices to WATCH said video and render our expensive large screen TV's pretty much useless when it comes to cable tv and watching it, without a cable box. Customers can buy their own routers, modems and TiVo like devices. We can buy OTA tuner boxes, etc.. We can buy DVR's. We can buy blah blah blah. Why can't we own our OWN set to boxes?
