Im sure youve seen the memes about adulting. Adulting means paying the bills, getting out of bed, going to work, doing all the boring, routine stuff thats part of being a grownup.
Adultingis how I came up with the concept of humaning. Humaning means extending kindness toward another person, offering a compliment, holding a door open, doing the things that make you a good, decent human.
The difference is that you dont always want to adult, but you DO want to human.
So Ive been trying to teach my son to be a decent human, and I believe that involves acknowledging the existence of other people and offering a salutation. Basically, I just want him to say Good morning, Good afternoon, or at the very least, Hi, when we see other people. But my child is bashful. Usually when he encounters someone
anyone
thats his cue to grab my leg and duck behind me. (Unless its a cat, lizard, or his own reflection, and then hell talk all day long.)
It goes a little something like this:
ME: See our neighbor? Can you say hi to our neighbor?
SON:
ME: Theres the mailman! Say hi to the mailman.
SON:
ME: Look at the man walking the doggie! Can you say hi to the doggie?
SON:
Recently there was amoment when I countedon my son to ignore a person, and of course, thats when he did the opposite.
ME: (sees a vagrant hunched over on the street corner, vomiting into a shoe)
SON: HIIIIII! Hi! Hi! HIIIIIIII! Hello? Hi! Hi!
I was incredibly frustrated by this. Of all the people to greet on the street, my son chooses the one who smells like last weeks bottle ofMad Dog. Then my friend Chris, who is the father of three boys, set me straight.
Chrissaid, Having experienced this a lot, we have a theory that toddlers say hi to the people who probably need to be said hi to. Thus: the homeless, the ancient, the forgotten, the scary, the unkempt, the very sick, the sad, the lonely, the unusual-looking. He was showering an unclean man with pure love.
That took my breath away.
People often say a little child shall lead them. In my case, he is
and in the process, hes teaching me a lot about humaning.
