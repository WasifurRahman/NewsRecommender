Comment: Common-sense ruling by magistrates over taking children out of school
Updated 4:39pm Monday 2nd May 2016 in
TWO sets of Swindon parents accused of failing to ensure their childrens attendance at school have had the charges against them dismissed by magistrates.
The decision was a wise one, and we hope it will set a common-sense precedent.
Laws to ensure school attendance are vital, as chronic non-attendance blights a childs education - and therefore the rest of their life.
See our full story here
Unfortunately, a lack of clarity around the current regulations means those regulations are prone to being used inappropriately and counter-productively.
In the latest Swindon case, the children involved had attendance records in excess of 90 per cent, and their parents decided to take them out of school for family holidays.
While there is abundant evidence that chronic truancy can have a disastrous effect on a childs education, there is no credible evidence that removing a child from school for a few days holiday has any negative effect whatsoever.
Nor is there any suggestion that the parents of the children in this instance are in any way neglectful or otherwise inadequate as nurturers and caregivers.
That being the case, was it really necessary to haul them before a court?
Quite apart from being a questionable use of scarce resources, such cases have a negative impact on public opinion. There is a perception, whether accurate or not, that respectable parents are targeted as low-hanging fruit while the genuinely neglectful are allowed to carry on regardless.
If a law intended to safeguard children from the effects of neglect comes to be seen as unfair, that is a cue for the laws administrators to consider adjusting their attitudes.

While I understand that taking children out of school during term time can have a small-time negative effect on their learning, there's has to be a degree of common sense also used. This article says that the attendance of the children was over 90% before this 'holiday', so I honestly don't see it as much of a problem, myself. I missed a few days here and there when I was back at school, and it didn't have a detrimental affect on my learning either.

Councils & gov really need to get a grip!
I missed about 5 months schooling in year 4, in year 6 I was given year 5 work as the stupid substitute thought I was in year 5 as sat at a table with younger people so given the wrong work for almost a year. I also missed 6 months of schooling in year 11 due to being bullied for sexuality and still managed to pass all of my exams, despite the school being instructed to send my work home they never did! Bar German, D&T & literature which I was forced to drop I passed and received 7 grade A-C's, including an A in Art (almost A*) and wasn't far off the predicted grades!
A few days isn't going to make a difference! Oh it might make kids happy though & happy kids probably do better!
Why can't schools just give kids extra homework if its such a problem!
On another note half the subjects are nonesence anyway - William the conquerer ? Henry the 8th ? Really ? Ateast at home kids learn PRACTICAL life skills! Like how to shop/cost of food, how to iron, how to clean, bake, & cook a REAL meal etc. School only taught me how to bake a disgusting cake with about 3 ingredients.
I learnt more useful skills at home than I did in school.

And at home is precisely where those skills should be learned, or did your prolonged absences from school deprive you of understanding what a 'national curriculum' is?
Education is not 'free', it's paid for by the taxpayer. The least parents can do is respect that, as well as term times and the law. Now these parents have gotten away with it, brace for the rush of others following suit. If parents can't demonstrate respect and discipline, what chance do their offspring have?

you clearly have not looked at the price difference on holidays in term and out of term, let me clear....it is NOT a small change, we are talking well over double the cost.
I think the government should be looking at the unfair way the holiday companies treat familes during the holidays because if they were priced the same outside of term as inside then this wouldnt be an issue.
The lack of attendance policy should be targeting parents who consistently fail to get their kids to school i.e. - cant be bothered, not the ones that take them on a cheeky holiday which might take them from the classroom but still provides an education of some sort such as life skills.
Having a 100 fine is not going to stop parents who save 2000 by going in term time - and yes it is about 2000 saved on an average family holiday

Ah of course, it's just a 'cheeky' holiday to you, isn't it, save a few quid by going in term time. And then everyone wants to do the same, and so what then, term times are expected to change to accommodate selfish parents who want their two weeks in Benidorm cheap? And of course the holiday companies will spot the trend, and on and on it goes. Parents used to make sacrifices for their children. I forgot we were dealing with Generation Me.

They (the parents) have "gotten away" with nothing.
By understanding the law and what it actually states and more importantly what it doesn't state there was no case to answer.
Councils have used the poor government guidance to "bully" parents into paying penalty notices (they are not fines; only a court can issue a fine) by threatening the courts and a criminal conviction.
Roll on the High Court date in May.

Of course they 'got away with it'. They escaped prosecution because of a poorly-written law which failed to define what common sense would instantly recognise; a mistake which will doubtless be corrected.
