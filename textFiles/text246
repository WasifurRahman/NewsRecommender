Gerber Technology's Digital Solution Links Data, Smart Machines to Drive Mass Production and Mass Customization
[May 03, 2016]
Gerber Technology's Digital Solution Links Data, Smart Machines to Drive Mass Production and Mass Customization
Tweet
TOLLAND, Conn., May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --Gerber Technology, the world leader in integrated software and automation solutions for the apparel and industrial markets, is showcasingitsDigital Solution at the Texprocess Americas show in Atlanta.
Apparel and industrial companies are under significant competitive pressures to design, develop and produce their products faster and more efficiently while ensuring they get the right products to market at the right time and at the right price. Whether producing volume for the masses or customizing small lots, companies arestruggling because of an inability to move data from process to process and machine to machine.At Texprocess, Gerber will demonstrate each step of itsDigital Solution to illustrate how companies can network theirsoftware andsmart machinesto form an end-to-end solution to help meet the workflow challenges of mass production and mass customization.
"Regardless, if you're producing 10,000 shirts a day or personalizing jerseys for asportsteam, the key to successis a digitized network that allows you to move information throughout your supply chain down to the equipment level and back," saidMike Elia, CEOof Gerber Technology. Elia continued, "Integrating the flow of data and leveraging IoT technology provides companies with the valuable insight they need to remain agile and optimize their supply chain."
The hub of Gerber's Digital Solution is YuniquePLM product lifecycle management software. Serving as a central repository of critical data,YuniquePLMeliminates problems companies often face when using multiple Excel spreadsheets or tracking documents to communicate throughout the stages of product development and management. YuniquePLM creates a single version of the truth, connecting a company's creative process with their supply chain and production processes.
YuniquePLM transfers data to AccuMark and AccuPlan, Gerber's industry leading intelligent pattern design, grading, marker making and production planning software. At this critical design stage, global teams can leveage Gerber's AccuMark 3D to collaborate in a virtual environment, annotating and making revisions to a design to create a virtual sample
eliminating cost and time associated with making physical samples. Once the design is finalized, the data from the design files is run through AccuPlan to generate a marker and optimize material utilization.
Since Gerber's Digital Solution architecture uses common file structures, data can easily be passed to the cut room, where smart machines, like the GERBERspreader XLsseries and Paragon line of multi-plyGERBERcutters, can process the order with a simple barcode scan. A closed looped, end-to-end Digital Solutions like Gerber's that integrates software and smart machines, allows companies to automate their entire process and streamline data and workflow necessary to provide insight, maximize throughput, minimize errors and reduce labor costs to be competitive in mass production environments.
While many segments of the garment industry utilize this mass automation approach, Gerber also sees continued growth in personalized apparel around the globe. To successfully address this trend, manufacturers will need to leverage digitized networks to meet the challenges ofmass customization, or made-to-measure environments, while optimizing theirinventory levels.Here again, closed-loop networks like Gerber's Digital Solution make it possible to transferdata fromthe design room to smart machines capable of executing print-to-cut, completed made-to-measure and matching operations. At Texprocess, Gerber will demonstrate how AccuMark software integrated with Gerber'sContourVision andthe GERBERcutter Z1 can executescan-to-cut operations.
