Sown and Grown, a delicious new cereal brand, will also supply goodies for the event bags.
We know that PAs and EAs have to deal with all sorts of challenges and difficult situations on a daily basis
and that part of the job is having the confidence to deal with whatever is thrown at you, said Mark Doyle. I am really looking forward to sharing an innovative approach to help tackle some of those really difficult moments
and to meeting you all at the event.
