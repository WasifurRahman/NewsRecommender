Samsung is beefing up the middle of its UK smartphone range with an update that brings fast charging and a fingerprint scanner for around two hundred quid.The new 2016 versions of the Galaxy A3 and Galaxy A5 are powered by Android 5.1 Lollipop. Both boast a 13-megapixel main camera as well as a 5-megapixel camera on the front for selfies and video chat, with 16GB of storage on board and space for a microSD card.The Galaxy A5, which includes a fingerprint scanner, measures 5.2-inches to the A3's 4.7-inches. The A5 has a high definition 1080p display, while the A3 is 720p.Inside the A5 is a 1.6Ghz octa-core processor with 2GB of RAM and a 2900mAh battery to keep things ticking. The A3 runs on a 1.5GHz octa-core chip with 1.5GB of RAM and a 2300mAh battery. The new phones are set to be available across the networks and retailers from this Thursday, 5 May. They'll doubtless be subsidised heavily with your phone contract, but Samsung offers prices of 229 for the A5 while the A3 is around 179.Tags: PhonesSamsungDiscuss: Mid-range Samsung Galaxy A3 and A5 come to...Conversation powered by LivefyreShow CommentsHide CommentsFeatured Video
