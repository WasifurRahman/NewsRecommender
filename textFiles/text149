A [Gherkin][gherkin] runner for Python based on [Nose][nose] and
[Lettuce][lettuce].
Install:
pip install aloe
Read the [documentation][docs].
Invocation
aloe command line tool is a wrapper for the nose runner, configured to only
run Gherkin tests. As such, the invocation is the same as nose, but the
following parameters are added:
-n N[,N] - only run the specified scenarios (by number, 1-based) in each
feature. Makes sense when only specifying one feature to run, for example
aloe features/calculator.feature -n 1
test-class - override the class used as a base for each feature.
no-ignore-python - run Python tests as well as Gherkin.
Migrating from Lettuce
Aloe, started as a fork of Lettuce, tries to be compatible where it makes
sense. However, there are following incompatible changes:
each_scenario and each_background callbacks are removed. Use
each_example.
-s option for running particular scenarios is renamed to -n.
Django-related functionality, including the harvest command, is moved to a
separate project, [Aloe-Django][aloe-django].
terrain.py has no particular significance. It will be imported but only if
it exists at the same directory with the other step definition files, and not
above it.
Scenario outlines must be declared with Scenario Outline, and scenarios
without examples must use Scenario - Lettuce allowed using either.
By default, the steps run are output as dots, corresponding to Lettuce
verbosity 1. To get colored output with steps printed as they run, use -v 3.
