Letter: Dont let stopping Trump corrupt GOP process
First Published 17 minutes ago
Updated 17 minutes ago
Share This Article
I am by no means a Republican or a Donald Trump supporter. I, in fact, am not sure I support any of the candidates in the current presidential race.
I do, however, find it interesting that there are multiple so-called "delegates" on the Republican side who are saying they will not have to vote for Trump in the first round of voting even if he reaches the coveted delegate count of 1,237. Talk of changing the rules for deciding who the Republican nominee will be has been floated if Trump does reach the 1,237 delegates.
This would be disregarding the will of the people so far in this race, validating all claims that the political game is rigged. If the Republican National Committee and their delegates believe those who support Trump, and all U.S. citizens who value an open and free society, will just allow this to happen without much uproar, I believe they have quite the reckoning coming for them.

I would hope those who say they are speaking for the will of the people (the RNC and Republicans in general) will see the error of their ways and allow the process to play out without unwanted interference.
