Igniting creative sparks of innovation is in
Raj Kellampalli's DNA. Going out of his
way to appreciate, acknowledge the team
and motivate them to 'think out of the
box', Kellampalli, Founder and CTO, NetScore
Technologies encourages his employees to
bring in unconventional ideas and novel
applications to foster productivity in this
intricate market place. Turning thoughts
into action, Kellampalli steers NetScore
Technologies-a provider of turnkey solutions
to the enterprise resource planning (ERP)
sector, with immense passion and dedication.
Connecting NetSuite with web stores like
Amazon, eBay and third party logistics (3PLs)
for shipping integration for back end processes,
NetScore Technologies-the one stop shop
NetSuite consulting provider entered the ERP
market in 2007. "Initially started with an SAP
ERP platform, we stumbled upon NetSuite,
when it gained attraction. NetSuite was the ideal
software on the cloud in the SMB market and it
was a logical step to move to this direction,"
says Kellampalli.
NetSuite is a complete web-based solution, and
the only Software-as-a Service (SaaS) business
software that supports accounting, ERP, customer
relationship management (CRM), professional
services automation (PSA), and ecommerce. "By
exploring unconventional practices and stepping
into the unknown, we solely focus on the NetSuite
practice. Being a certified commerce agency
partner, we build webstores on Monte Blanc
SuiteCommerce Advanced technology that offers rich
user experience and content management capabilities
for retail and wholesale distribution customers. Value
added services like SEO increase store traffic and lead
conversion. As a software development network (SDN)
partner, we are also excited about building value added
Apps and connectors-that increase efficiency and
reduce operational costs for our customers," Kellampalli
elaborates.
Additionally, bombarded with ongoing IT
maintenance cost and legacy on-premise ERP solutions,
the need of the hour today is a drive towards a flexible,
cost effective ERP system that can connect financials,
customers and commerce in a single platform. "Solving
this menace, NetSuite ERP solution is an entirely cloud
based system that manages the global distribution
system in a single platform. 70 percent of customers
have quickbooks and third party ERP software
and they are just transitioning to the cloud. Some
clients still use legacy software, that are time
consuming and ineffective. We offer cost effective
ERP and value added implementation services to cater
to our customer requirements." The NetSuite Cloud ERP
software helps in ensuring faster deployment times,
reduced upfront investment and mobile connectivity.
Additionally, as a NetSuite SDN partner, the
firm offers Grid Order Entry App-serving to be
a huge time saver for retailers and wholesalers
entering matrix items on the purchase order and
sales orders for different company locations."Our
NetSuite-Amazon/eBay connectors help customers to
sell more on online market places. These connectors
have real-time inventory updatesand promotion features.
One Amazon connector can connect to multiple Amazon
webstores providing real cost savings to retailers
selling online. We have performed custom integration
with proprietary webstores, with market places like
Brandboom, connected with 3PLs and FTP," Kellampalli
elaborates.
Over the years, NetScore has assisted several clients
to solve their market challenges with their expert
consulting services and NetSuite solutions for SMBs.
For every business problem, the firm lays out various
design options and explains the pros and cons of each
approach. The firm also emphasizes on software design
and documentation to reduce maintenance costs for
customer. And therein lies the differentiator for NetScore.
In one instance, a client selling usedtires on Amazon and
eBay lacked real-time inventory updates and experienced
reduced sales. After using NetScore's Amazon/eBay
connector, not only did the client experience real time
inventory updates with the plug-ins but also attained
more leads with increased results. In another example, a
customer selling yoga accessories onlinefaced intricacies
regarding their order management. In order to solve the
hindrance, the client used NetScore's Grid order entry
Appthat helped the operations people to process sales
orders and purchase orders quickly.
What's next for NetScore? "Our focus is to expand
our sales and marketing operations in the U.S. With
respect to the ERP market, "we would like to expand
to Asia Pacific and Europe," explains Kellampalli.
"Additionally, we will continue to focus on building
applications for the retail, wholesale distribution and
general business verticals which includere curring
billing, loyalty App and Point of Sale (POS)," says
Kellampalli. "We at NetScore are on a mission to build
applications and intellectual property in the coming
years. The company's long term goals include plans
for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2018 and also
expanding into other cloud offerings. "We would also
pay keen attention to increasing the development head
count in India," concludes Kellampalli.
