The Rhode Island Department of Transportation has asked the Town of Hopkinton to name at least one representative to the design committee for the new state Travel Plaza and Transit Center.
At Mondays Town Council meeting, President Frank Landolfi said he and Town Manager William McGarry were meeting today with state officials to discuss the project, and he asked council members for their questions and concerns.
I need some input from you, he said. What do we want to tell these folks? They want to involve the town on the design committee, so they want somebody to be appointed for that. Let me know what your thoughts are on this project. It looks like its going full steam ahead.
The 6,000-square-foot facility, located on a 20-acre site on the southeast corner of the intersection of I-95 and Route 3, is expected to cost at least $12 million to build.
The U.S. Department of Transportation has already approved a $9 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, or TIGER, grant for the construction of the new center, which will offer food, restrooms, bicycle amenities and tourist information. A park-and-ride facility for up to 200 cars will serve RIPTA and bus passengers as well as commuters who carpool.
The state is expected to issue a request for design-and-construction proposals this summer, construction will begin in 2017, and the center is scheduled to open in 2019.
RIDOT Acting Chief Public Information Officer Charles St. Martin said the new facility would improve traffic flow on I-95 by offering more options for mass transit.
I-95 as it passes through Rhode Island is heavily traveled, with daily congestion and vehicle crashes, he said. Widening the interstate is not an option, but increasing transit options is. Rhode Island is the second most densely populated state, yet its transit utilization is well below the national average. This project would enable increased transit options not only for those heading to Providence but to popular beach and tourism destinations in Newport and South County.
Council member Sylvia Thompson, who met with RIDOT officials several months ago, said it was clear even then that the agency wanted to involve the town in planning the project.
They want the town involved, and there are a number of options to be decided
the theme, the type of restaurants, all sorts of things, she said.
Thompson said she and other town officials who attended the meeting had suggested modifying the orientation of the building, and preserving trees to help the facility blend in.
They also wanted input on the outside, she added. What sort of amenities would you have? Do you want to do granite, do you want a lighthouse, how do you want this to appear? So for the design committee, we would want people from Hopkinton. We might want more than one if theyll accept that.
Council Vice President Barbara Capalbo listed several concerns that she wanted Landolfi to present at todays meeting. Like Thompson, she wants to preserve the trees on Route 3. She said she is also concerned about historic cemeteries on the property and ensuring that all lighting would be dark sky-compliant.
There are three historic cemeteries right in that area that I think they can avoid, she said. Id also like to make sure that they keep the lighting as low as possible.
Councilor David Husband asked Landolfi to raise the subject of tax revenue that the town would have received from commercial development on the site and what it will be losing when the state builds there.
Id like to know what theyre going to do about taxes, as far as our loss, he said. Were going to have a loss with that property. Its prime commercial property.
While not an enthusiastic supporter of the transit center, Landolfi conceded that it was important for the town to have input in the project.
If we didnt get involved in some way, they may bypass our opinion, and I dont want that to happen either, he said.
Both Thompson and Capalbo said they would be interested in serving on the design committee.
