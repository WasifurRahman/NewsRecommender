Boy, 12, punched twice by taxi driver
Police are appealing for information after a 12-year-old boy was punched twice in the face by a taxi driver.
The boy was assaulted on Broadwell Road in Middlesbrough, near to Beechwood and Easterside Social Club, at 7.40am on April 26.
Police say a snowball 'accidentally hit a taxi' and an argument began between the driver and three young boys.
The victim was left with minor facial injuries but did not receive medical treatment.
The driver is described as an Asian male, around 5ft 6 tall, aged between 20 and 30 years old with short, black hair which was spikey on top. He was wearing a black hooded top and was driving a red Skoda Octavia taxi.
