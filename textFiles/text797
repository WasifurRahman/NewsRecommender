We are disappointed with the way we bowled tonight. We have struggled in the middle overs to get wickets. Tonight it was about trying to get wickets. We didnt bowl too many balls which were fullthat was the plan, but the execution was pretty poor, he told reporters at post-match press conference in Bangalore.
KKR, riding high on superlative knocks from the blades of Russel and Pathan, tore apart the RCB bowling attack, before they helped snatching the game away from the jaws of the hosts by a margin of five wickets.
Batting first, RCB had notched up 185 for seven and then lost the battle to KKR who got 189 for five with five balls to spare.
We needed to get Russell and Yusuf out if we had to have a chance, and it didnt come off, he said.
He further said the West Indian made the difference by scoring boundaries and sixes in quick time.

Thats the perfect way to go about hitting boundaries and sixes, which took the game to us. When they came in their team was under pressure and knew if they lost a wicket, the game would have swung in our favour. Russell, even though he likes pace on the ball, he still hit a couple of our spinners. So credit must go to him definitely, he said.
Asked whether 185 runs were enough for RCB to make a match out of it, Binny said the team got more than the expected total of 170, but lost the match from 12th over onwards during KKR run-chase.
We had no plans to get 180. We were looking to get 165-170 and we ended up getting one big over at a stage where we could push the game. We bowled well in the first eight overs. We had them trying to catch up with the run rate, but lost it from the 12th over onwards, he said.
When asked should English pacer Chris Jordon coming into the attack in death overs, Binny said obviously the team needs someone who could do well in such situations.
Thats not for me to decide. Its for the management to decide. Definitely we are looking for someone who can do well in the death for us, he said.

Obviously it has not gone according to plan at the death, especially at the Chinnaswamy, the ball seems to travelevery third ball is going over the ropes in death overs. It is all about getting our execution right and I dont think we got that right, he said.
