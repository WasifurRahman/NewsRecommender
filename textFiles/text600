The past 100 years of theYMCA South and Mid Canterbury will be captured on the pages of a book to be published next year.A project team wants past participants, board members, employees, volunteers and supporters to share their memories andhelpcapture the local history and impact of the YMCA.Drive to Work manager Sharyn Kake has plenty of memories of the YMCA - shestarted with the organisation10 years agowhen it was based in Stafford Mall."It was a rabbit warren and very dark," Kake said.But within two years of starting, the YMCA moved to the light and roomy Butler Stbuilding, where it still remains.It was one of the major changes for Kake, who saidher programme hadbecome a shorter, tighteroperation over her 10 years."People used to stay indefinitely, now people progress a bit faster," she said.The 13 week programme helped people to improve their employment opportunities by upskilling and boosting their confidence:"We're getting better results."There weremore people moving through the programme now than when Kake first started."For mereflecting on the past, it's great to see the successes," she said.
