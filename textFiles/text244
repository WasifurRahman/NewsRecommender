Health Catalyst Chief Clinical Officer Recognized as One of Healthcare IT's Most Powerful Women
[May 03, 2016]
Health Catalyst Chief Clinical Officer Recognized as One of Healthcare IT's Most Powerful Women
Tweet
SALT LAKE CITY, May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --Health Catalyst, a leader in healthcare data warehousing, analytics and outcomes improvement, today congratulated Executive Vice President and Chief Clinical Officer Holly Rimmasch on being named to Health Data Management's list of "Healthcare IT's Most Powerful Women."
The awards are designed to recognize the achievements of women executives in healthcare IT, a field traditionally dominated by men that still lacks gender diversity, according to the magazine's editors. "The financial importance of gender diversity in the executive ranks and on corporate boards is becoming more apparent in the public consciousness every year, but the percentage of women who hold leadership positions in healthcare IT remains stubbornly low," they write in describing the award.
Rimmasch will accept her award at Health Data Management's Most Powerful Women in Healthcare IT conference, May 12, 2016 in Boston.
"We congratulate Holly on this well-deserved honor," said Dan Burton, Chief Executive Officer of Health Catalyst. "Holly's contribution to Health Catalyst is profound. She brings a depth of expertise about the healthcare setting and healthcare operations gained from the many years she spent as a front line clinician, as well as a hard-earned understanding of effective deployment practices. She is a pioneer i clinical improvement initiatives whose expertise about the healthcare setting and healthcare operations has contributed to the health of people across the country. We're lucky to have her on our team."
In her nearly four years as a senior executive at Health Catalyst, Rimmasch has been instrumental in driving the company's remarkable growth. As Chief Clinical Officer her primary responsibility is to bridge the gap between technology and the clinical world to ensure that Health Catalyst's products and services are being developed in a way that enables healthcare organizations to take full advantage of the data they already own across many disparate systems to effect real change in a way that benefits patients as well as the organization.
By applying her three decades of clinical and healthcare management experience, Rimmasch helps clients understand how their products and services will be applied to eliminating waste and systematically standardizing best practices across hospitals and health systems. In particular, she has spearheaded the creation of Health Catalyst's "Three Systems" approach to performance improvement: a combination of 1) data warehousing and analytics technology, 2) organizational change management, and 3) the consistent integration of evidence-based best practices into everyday care delivery.
Prior to joining Health Catalyst, Rimmasch spent 20 years pioneering systems for improving clinical care through implementation of clinical and operational best practices, most recently as an Assistant Vice President at Intermountain Healthcare responsible for Clinical Services. She was integral in promoting integration of clinical operations across hospitals, ambulatory settings and managed care plans using data and analytics as key tools. This pioneering work caught the attention of health systems throughout the country. Prior to her role in Clinical Services, she served as the Clinical Operations Director and Vice-Chair of Intermountain's Cardiovascular and Intensive Medicine Clinical Programs. She also was the co-founder of and Principal in HMS, Inc., a healthcare consulting firm focusing on assessing, developing strategies and implementing best practices for populations across the continuum of care.
"I am extremely grateful to Health Data Management for naming me one of Healthcare IT's Most Powerful Women, especially in light of the amazing work done by the other executives on the list," said Rimmasch. "To the extent that I've been successful, however, the credit really belongs to our extraordinary clients, whose commitment to making US healthcare a better, more efficient and cost-effective system for all Americans is truly something to watch."
