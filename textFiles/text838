Former Baltimore City Mayor and Democratic Mayoral Candidate Sheila Dixonwas speaking out on WBAL News Now with Bryan Nehman.
Dixon still believes that she has a chance to be mayor of Baltimore andrefused to concede the race to State Senator Catherine Pugh. Dixonwants to wait until all votes will be counted.
It was recently announced that agroup of voters and activists are going to ask Governor Larry Hogan to order a halt to certifying election results in Baltimore City, to allow the Office of State Prosecutor to investigate irregularities in voting during Tuesday's primary.
Hassan Giordano says the effort is not tied to any candidate, or campaign, though some campaigns may launch their own lawsuits to try to block the returns from being certified.
Giordano did support former Mayor Sheila Dixon in this year's primary.
