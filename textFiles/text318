Amy Schumer in Alexander Wang at the Met Gala: red hot or not?

Comedienne and recent Vanity Fair cover model Amy Schumer may not be taking photos with fans anymore, but she posed on the red carpet at last nights Met Gala in a tangerine-hued gown by Alexander Wang. The gown featured chain shoulder straps, cutouts, and an up to there thigh high split. She complemented the gown with a matching bag and strappy sandals. Theres something off about this gown for me. It makes her look like she has terrible posture and that top part is doing nothing for her boobs. I also wish she would have put her hair up. I do like her makeup though.
Fun fact: Amy has a unique way of dealing with chafing. She posted a quick video on her Instagram of her applying deodorant to the inside of her thighs with the caption, No chafe #nothighgapnoproblem. Maybe a little TMI there, Amy? I really cant imagine she really has this issue, I think shes just going for the laugh.

Neighbors 2 star Chlo Grace Moretz attended the event clad in a black gown from Coach. The gown featured a plunging neckline and a front sheer panel. I love her hair and makeup and the fact that she didnt wear a lot of jewelry, opting only for earrings. The dress thoughis is just me, or is the fabric giving anyone else a matronly kind of vibe? I know the sheer panel gives the gown a bit of an edge, but this whole look makes her look older, and not so much in a good way.
Hailey Baldwin also looks like she grabbed something from her mothers closet. The 18-year-old model wore a black and silver sequined striped gown by Tommy Hilfiger. The dress featured a side split and cutout back panel. She accessorized with a clutch by Edie Parker and strappy Stuart Weitzman heels. I love the back of the dress, but the front is doing nothing for me. I also love her slick ponytail and, no shocker, her makeup was on point.

Juno Temple, who I loved on HBOs Vinyl, gave me a 70s vibe with her gown by Erdem. Im sensing a trend here, as this lacy number makes the 26-year-old actress look much older. The waistline on the dress is too low to be an empire and too high to be a true waistline. I dont know why that bugs me so much. I do love her ringlets and makeup though. And Juno looks like she likes the dress, she brought the designer as her date, posting a photo with him with the caption, Best prom date ever. I think a real prom dress may have been a better choice.

Amys dress is a no for me and the hair just makes it worse. Not cute and she always does this weird bed head thing.
Chloe is alright the dress is a little old on her.

Amys dress is a BIG no.
It does her no favours, and wearing her hair down with that make up makes her look like she just rolled out of bedbut not in a good way.

Living in the moist heat of the south, if your thighs even *think* about touching, you get chafing. Once it starts, theres no stopping it and you are uncomfortable the entire time. Deodorant on the inner thighs
is a must for me in the summer on the rare occasion I wear a dress or skirt. If its really hot, I will sometimes pat baby powder over it to make double sure theres no rubbing. Thanks, Amy, glad to see I am not the only one LOL.

Im with you. And really, do you need to show a video of how to put deodorant on your inner thighs? Not that I would ever do that in the first place, but couldnt you just tell people that you put deodorant on your inner thighs and let them figure it out from there? How many ways could somebody f that up that they need an instructional video? Oh THOSE inner thighs! Help me find my inner thighs? Im not sure I have inner thighs, let me check, oh shes right, I do!

If youre Amy and a make a living pushing the envelope aka being as gross and shocking as possible, this video makes perfect sense.
I do not like Amys dress or her hair. I really just dont like her so its difficult to find nice things to say about the way she looks. Thats mean of me. Ill work on it.

GNAT- agreed. I think she does stuff like this to be funny but her humor falls flat with me. Shes the TMI queen I guess.
QQ she does have a case of Cabbage Patch face
At least she knows it. Now Im pressed to see a baby pic of hers! She also reminds me of Annoying Orange. My students used to watch that dumb show.

It seems like the theme of the gala was a little too high-fashion for most of the guests. No one really looked amazing. The best looks were ones that werent too offensive. Just my impression.

Amys dress makes her look flattened from the front, like she got run over by a steam roller. From the side it is not so bad, but the red shade is not good for her
she cant pull it off. Something softer would have been better. And of course, a different dress and a different personality
