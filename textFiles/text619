Wild Bunch will kick-off pre-sales at Cannes on Oscar-winner Michel Hazanaviciuss [pictured] new projectRedoubtablerevolving around the relationship between Jean-Luc Godard and actress Anne Wiazemsky in the late 1960s.Based on Wiazemskys autobiographical accountUn An Aprs,the production will star Louis Garrel as Jean-Luc Godard and Stacy Martin, last seen inHigh-Rise, as the directors young muse.The script kicks off with the 1967 shoot of La Chinoise about a group of students who try to live by Maoists principles - and follows the couple through the late 1960s when Godard went through his so-called revolutionary period.Wiazemsky
who met Godard when she was just 17-years-old and he was on the rebound from Anna Karina
was married to the filmmaker for more than a decade.Like Hazanaviciuss Oscar-winningThe Artist, the aesthetics and style of Redoubtablewill take inspiration from the films around which the story is set.Its an homage to Godard and the films he was making in 1968 at the same time as gently poking fun at some of their characteristics, such as the slogans etc, said Wild Bunch sales chief Vincent Maraval.Its not exactly a comedy but it will be lighted-hearted and affectionate in style.Hazanavicius is producing the film alongside Florence Gastaud, best known in the French film industry as managing director of the influential directors guild ARP, and actor and director Riad Sattouf.Studiocanal has snapped up French rights on the project which is currently in pre-production.Wild Bunch has also taken on sales of Arnaud Desplechins new projectLes Fantomes dIsmal - also in pre-production - about a filmmaker whose life is sent into a tailspin by the return of a former lover just as he is about to embark on the shoot of a new film.Arnaud is on the jury so he will be in Cannes and will able to meet buyers to present the project, said Maraval.The director has gathered together an ensemble cast, including Mathieu Amalric, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Marion Cotillard and Louis Garrel. It is produced by Why Not Productions.Other new French productions on the slate include Gilles Bourdoss inter-generational dramaEndangered Species, revolving around three interconnected families and the lengths people will go to protect their nearest and dearest, at the same time unwittingly doing them harm. The film is currently is in post-production.Upcoming films on the Wild Bunch slate include Michal R. RoskamsThe Racer And The Jailbird- currently shooting - about a dangerous love affair between gangster Gino and wealthy young racing driver Benedicte, who meet against the backdrop of the racing circuit.Long-time Roskam collaborator Matthias Schoenaerts is set to play Gino opposite Adele Exarchopoulos as Benedicte. The actress, who won the Palme dOr for her performance inBlue Is The Warmest Colourin 2014, will be in Cannes this year in Sean PennsThe Last Face.Roskam co-wrote the script with respected French screenwriters Thomas Bidegain and Noe Debre. Brussels-based Savage Film is co-producing with Pierre-Ange Le Pogams Paris-based Stone Angels. Path has already taken French rights.Wild Bunch will also launch sales on Ukrainian filmmaker and Cannes regular Sergei Loznitsas upcoming filmA Gentle Creature.Inspired by a Dostoyevsky short story, the film follows a woman who sets off for a remote, lawless part of Russia in search of the truth regarding her prisoner-husbands fate after a parcel she sends him is returned, marked return to sender.The company is also handling sales on director Andrey Zvyagintsevs Lovelessrevolving around a couple going through a bitter divorce.Russian producers Alexander Rodnyansky and Sergey Melkumov
who produced Zvyagintsevs Oscar-nominatedLeviathan are teaming up with Paris-based Why Not Productions on the film.Previously announced titlesThe company will continue sales on Jacques DoillonsRodin, starring Vincent Lindon as the legendary sculptor, which is due to shoot just after Cannes.Izia Higelin has recently boarded the project for the role of Rodins lover Camille Claudel. Sverine Caneele, who has rarely been seen on the big screen since her Palme dOr-winning performance in Bruno Dumonts 1999LHumanit, will play Rodins long-suffering wife Rose Beuret.Well have the script for the first time, said Maraval.Other previously announced projects include Claire Deniss space fantasyHigh Life, starring Robert Pattinson, Patricia Arquette and Mia Goth; Lino Disalvios Playmobil, which the company is co-selling with Lionsgate, and the Nicolas Winding Refn-producedManiac Cop.Well have a new script co-written by Ed Brubaker and John Hyams at Cannes.

Emir loves to go to Cannes so he sent us a rough cut running two hours and forty minutes after the press conference but it just wasnt ready. Theres at least two months of post-production left, said Maraval. The editing is not difficult but there are a lot of special effects.Cannes titlesThe company is handling ten titles that are due to premiere in Cannes Official Selection or in one of the parallel sections.Its line-up includes Palme dOr contendersI, Daniel Blake,Staying Vertical, Graduation,The Neon DemonandThe Unknown Girl;Un Certain Regard titles After The Storm,The Dancer,The Red Turtleand Jean-Francois Richets Mel Gibson-starrerBlood Father, which will premiere in a Midnight Screening.Outside Official Selection, the company is also selling Julia DucournausRaw about a young women brought up as a vegetarian who tastes meat for the first time with unexpected consequences
