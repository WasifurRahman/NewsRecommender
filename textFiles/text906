VIDEO: Swindon Festival of Literature heralded by dawn chorus
Updated 4:34pm Monday 2nd May 2016 in
By Stephen Davy-Osborne, Reporter
A DAWN chorus of bag pipes, a flute, an accordion and a watering can officially kicked off the 23rd Swindon Festival of Literature as the sun rose this morning.
Held in the Lawn Woods from 5.30am, more than 200 people braved the very early start to see in the sunrise and get a taste of what was to come during the coming two weeks of the festival.
Festival organiser Matt Holland greeted the guests and thanked them for ignoring the weather forecast and setting their alarms for before 5am before Jake the Juggler and his merry band of performers wowed with their acrobatic displays.
Andria Walton was on hand to play a pretty tune on her pennywhistle while reading extracts from The Bard in the 400th anniversary year of Shakespeares death, while community poet Tony Hillier celebrated the completion of the Bruce Street Bridges work in a specially written poem for the occasion.
There was also an international feel to the launch, with traditional dancing from Swindons twin town Ocotal, hinting of celebrations to come later in the festival of this international link.
The festival was also treated to a rousing rendition of Feeling Good by firm festival favourites the Sun Arise Singers
an offshoot of Swindon Community Choir.
Linda Lee, choir leader and founder, said that it would be strange to think of the ffestival without the singers performance.
Every year I think, should I really get up that early and do it? But it would be very weird not to have been part of it," she said.
When I am standing there with the choir silhouetted against the rising sun it is a fantastic moment. And the singers can see the sun rising on the faces of the people who have come to watch.
She sang the praises of the festival and urged people to seek out some of the festivals lesser-known writers and performers.
She said: It is a wonderful melting pot of ideas, it is not just about books and literature its all people coming and sharing wonderful ideas and it stimulates a lot of discussion.
"After these events there is always a real buzz because people are talking to each other all about what they have just seen and heard. There is a feeling that have grown and you have learned something.
The surprising thing about the festival is it is the often the things that you wouldnt necessarily think about going to that can sometimes be the most inspiring and rewarding.
"I think people should just take pot luck and try something they wouldnt normally go to and find they have learned something new.
The festival continues today with a 5k freedom run led by international triathlete Fiona Ford at Lydiard Park where she will be discussing her new book Back on Track.
Historian and walker Steve Mynard will also be leading a steady walk around the lake where he will be telling stories from here, there and everywhere.
There will also be an afternoon of railway fun at the Richard Jeffries Museum where youngsters can build cardboard trains, tell stories and sing songs.
Events will be rounded off at Lower Shaw Farm this evening with a talk by Lucy Jones who will tackle to controversial issue of our relationship with foxes.
