Markets are showing signs of fatigue ahead of key policy meetings from Bank of Japan and the US Fed later this week. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Udayan Mukherjee says the correction in the Nifty has been modest.
From mid-February onwards, a lot of emerging market indices have performed well. Largecaps, in particular, have rallied about 30-40 percent during this time and foreign direct investments have come down, says Mukherjee.
"And so there is no harm in taking profits and stepping to the sidelines," he says.
Global trends will play a key role in deciding how investors react in May -- and it would be best to take it one day at a time, says Mukherjee.
If the US Fed takes a hawkish view, panicking won't help. But worry you must if the Chinese economy turns sluggish or Brexit happens, because these developments would bring back fears that the world is slipping into a recession again, says Mukherjee.
As the earnings season in India kicked off last week, Mukherjee feels it has been a mixed bag.
Mukherjee would buy Axis Bank over
ICICI Bank
any day.
Axis Bank
is the best private sector bank, he feels, as its valuations are reasonable, and the management has shown far greater prudence.
