Automobile to Railcar conversions
Automobile to Railcar conversions
Hi, Bob Baxter sent me a slew of interesting railcar pics with the idea I share them here and there. So with that, heres a bunch of funky railcar conversions:
#12 is my favorite.
Ill keep these up for as long as I can, Im kinda short on storage space so sometime later this year I may have to delete some of these, so copy away if you see something you want to record.
