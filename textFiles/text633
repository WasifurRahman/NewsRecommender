Aeropostale May Shutter 100 Stores, File For Chapter 11
by Thom Forbes, , Featured Columnist,
32 minutes ago
Recommend (1)
Aropostale, which was born as a Macys private-label brand for teens and has grown into more than 700 retail shops after it set out on its own, will file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in the coming days and close more than 100 of its outlets before the May rent payments are due, the Wall Street Journal reports. The brand opened the first of its mall-based specialty
stores in 1987. Eleven years later, management joined with other executives and Bear Stearns Cos.s merchant banking business to buy the business. Aropostale went public in 2002,
writes Matt Jarzemsky. But the company, which had 21,000 employees as of January 2015, has posted losses in its last three fiscal years amid a steep decline in sales. The chain thrived in the 80s and 90s, but is now caught between competitors in the teen market like arch-nemesis American Eagle, as well as the upmarket Abercrombie
& Fitch and cheaper fast fashion retailers that also cater to teens and children, writes Laura Northrup for Consumerist. That would be the likes
of Forever 21, Uniqlo, and H&M, observes Phil Wahba for Fortune, reporting that Aropostales comparable
sales were off 6.7% during the 2015 holiday shopping quarter and are down 40% since it was in its prime six years ago. Aeropostales shares were delisted by the New York Stock Exchange last month after shares traded below $1 for an
extended period. Its current market value of $30 million is a fraction of that at its peak in 2010, when the company was worth $3 billion on the stock market, Wahba writes. Aropostale said in March it was exploring a potential
sale of the company, Brian Sozzi reminds us on TheStreet. With its financials in shambles because of a series of fashion missteps and heightened competition, Aropostale
said it would re-brand some of its mall stores into what it calls Aropostale Factory. According to the company, about 60% of its stores
or roughly 486
tend to
attract customers looking for basic, affordable items such a hoodies and t-shirts with an Aropostale logo. Running under the headline These Photos Support
Reports of Aropostale's Looming Bankruptcy, Sozzis story is illustrated by one forlorn storefront with a gate down and another picture of a Garden City, N.Y., shop where
amidst warmer spring temperatures on Saturday, Aropostale was trying to hawk its brand new t-shirt styles for $3.99, likely in a bid to get cash into the business. Other retailers in their adolescence have certainly shared the chains misery of late. The last two years have been unkind to mid-range teen-focused
clothing retailers, withDEB,Wet Seal, anddELiA*s, shutting down, andPacSun reorganizing under bankruptcy protection, Northrup points
out. A bankruptcy out of Aropostale would have been unthinkable a decade ago, when the company was the cheapest of the three As behind American Eagle
and Abercrombie, selling a logo-laden version of teen prepdom that reigned supreme in the suburbs. The store has changed in recent years as teens have abandoned logo-driven clothing in pursuit of
fast-fashion chains like H&M, skate-inspired looks, and athletic brands like Nike, writes Sapna Maheshwari for BuzzFeed, citing Nomura Securities analyst Simeon
Siegel'sobservation a few months ago. The three As had to reinvent
themselves, he said. They used to be able to take a polo shirt, decide what the components would be, slap an animal on it and charge varying degrees based on what the animal was. That
doesnt work anymore. Its efforts to rebrand itself as Aero in 2014 with a flurry of social media placements
on the likes of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest and Vine also didnt work,
apparently. In addition to its Web sites, the company operates more than 700 Aropostale stores principally targeting 14-to-17 year olds in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and
Canada, as well as 25 P.S. from Aropostale stores in the U.S. that cater to the 4-to-12 year-old market. Since November 2012, it also has operated GoJane.com, an online women's fashion
footwear and apparel retailer. In addition, licensees operate more than 300 Aropostale and P.S. from Aropostale locations in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, according to the companys corporate profile page. Jay Gee
Melwani Group, distributor of the brand at four locations in Singapore and two others in Malaysia, tells the Straits Times Wong Siew Ying that it
has not yet heard from New York HQ about the chains future direction. The stores will remain open for the time being, as long as they are able to supply us the
goods, says managing director R Dhinakaran.
