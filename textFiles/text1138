Teddy Dief and Renaud Bdard now working at Lara Croft Go, teasing something special
Two notable indie developers have joined Square Enixs Montreal studio.
Teddy Dief, who developed Hyper Light Drifter, has been hired as creative director and will leave his current studio Heart Machine, GamesIndustry reports.
He will be working alongside fellow new recruit Renaud Bdard, one of the programmers behind indie hit Fez. Bdard teases via Twitter that the project the duo will be working on is something special.
Square Enix announced the hire via Twitter, which you can see below. The Montreal team focuses on mobile games based on Squares IP, and is best known for the Hitman and Lara Croft Go titles, as well as portable shooter Hitman: Sniper.
We're incredibly humbled and excited to be adding 2 rad creatives to our team - welcome @renaudbedard & @TeddyDief! pic.twitter.com/4xrD3wKkPW
