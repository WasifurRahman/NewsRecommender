New BMP-1 upgrade developed in Ukraine
Christopher F Foss, London - IHS Jane's International Defence Review
03 May 2016
Ukrainian industry has developed to the prototype stage a major upgrade package for the Russian BMP-1 tracked infantry fighting vehicle (IFV).
The first prototype vehicle, designated the BMP-1 UM IFV, is being tested in Ukraine.
The extensive modifications include the replacement of the original one-man BMP-1 turret, which was armed with a 73 mm 2A28 smoothbore gun, a 7.62 mm PKT co-axial machine gun (MG), and a KBM 9K11 Malyutka (Sagger) anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW) that was originally mounted on top of the main gun's barrel.
Many operators have removed the original wire-guided ATGW as it is difficult to control, especially in windy conditions.
