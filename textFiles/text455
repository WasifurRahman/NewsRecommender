Input sought on walk, bike plan: San Bruno residents invited to help design comprehensive transportation document
May 03, 2016, 05:00 AM By Austin Walsh Daily Journal
Officials interested in improving walking and biking paths in San Bruno are seeking the input of residents who use alternative modes of transportation traveling throughout their community.
An initial draft of the citys first comprehensive walk and bike plan was recently completed, and is up for community review during a workshop Tuesday, May 3, in the San Bruno Senior Center.
Feedback offered will help officials draft a plan designed to make it easier for residents to get out of their cars and move around town by foot or bicycle, according to David Woltering, San Brunos director of Community Development.
At this time, the activity for walkers and bikers is low compared to other communities in the area, he said. But the intent is, with improvements and education and a real focus on the benefits of walking and biking, that we can increase those numbers.
Officials collected roughly 1,300 comments from residents during a previous outreach campaign informing the initial draft formation, said Woltering, and the plan suggests a variety of projects which could be executed to address those concerns.
Enhanced safety initiatives at crosswalks such as installing flashing lights for pedestrians, extending curbs to shorten crossing distances, increasing the amount of time walk signals last for pedestrians are among those that could be implemented as part of the plan, said Woltering.
Other projects could be adding more signs throughout the city to remind drivers to be conscious of bikers and pedestrians, he said.
Our hope is as bikers and walkers feel safer, it is more convenient and there is more comfort moving about, people will walk or ride bikes in San Bruno, Woltering said.
The plan, once finalized, will ultimately be a document officials use to seek money from grants and the citys capital improvement budget to bring to fruition, said Woltering.
He said he believes the initiative could take as long as a decade to implement in full.
Our intent is to look forward for the next 10 years, prioritize measures, seek grant funding, go to the council for funds, then move forward with the projects, he said.
He said officials hope to connect neighborhoods, the downtown commercial district and transportation hubs through the plan, once it is entirely implemented.
We have both Caltrain and a Bay Area Rapid Transit station within San Bruno, and a real opportunity to link both our employment centers and housing to these transportation facilities by walking and biking, he said. So as we make our networks more complete and more safe and more comfortable, the intent is to hopefully increase substantially the amount of people that walk and bike in the community, and link up to transportation facilities that go beyond San Bruno.
Should officials achieve their goal, there are a variety of health and environmental benefits which could be brought to the San Bruno community, said Woltering.
Officials are hopeful to receive feedback on the plan from residents for the next month, before it is brought before the Planning Commission in June and the City Council in July. Input will be accepted until the plan is finalized by the council.
An intent of the plan is to really help move the community of San Bruno in a direction that is much more friendly to bicyclists and pedestrians and really encourage communities to walk to destinations, and biking as an alternative to single occupancy vehicles, he said.
The first community workshop is set to begin 7 p.m., Tuesday, May 3, in the San Bruno Senior Center, 1555 Crystal Springs Road.
