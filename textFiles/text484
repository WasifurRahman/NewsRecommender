North Dakota man plows Princes symbol in farm field
May 03, 2016, 05:00 AM The Associated Press
EDGELEY, N.D.
A retiree in a tiny community in North Dakota has paid tribute to Prince in perhaps the most unique way a farmer can.
Gene Hanson is a retired farmer in Edgeley who always liked the song Purple Rain. On Friday, he hopped on his tractor and plowed on a football field-size version of the late musicians symbol into his corn field.
The 75-year-old says he found an image of the symbol on the Internet. He put it on his tractors dash and followed the pattern. When done, he got on his airplane to check it out. He couldnt believe that it had turned out so well.
The tribute is only temporary. Hanson says the field was seeded Monday.
Prince died April 21 in suburban Minneapolis at age 57.
