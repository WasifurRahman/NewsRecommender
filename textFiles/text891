The Dennis-Yarmouth Regional School Committee voted to extend Superintendent Carol Woodburys contract for three more years, and to give her a four percent raise each of those years, bringing her 2017 salary to $166,395.School committee member Michelle Conover voted no when the committee moved to enter into executive session to discuss Woodburys salary, and abstained from the vote on Woodburys contract extension.During the public comment portion of the meeting, a number of district parents asked that the school committee delay voting on the contract.It saddens me that I have to be looking at alternative schools because of the performance of the district, said parent Susan Johnson, pointing out D-Y is a Leven 3 district. I dont think its really the time to consider negotiating a new contract for the superintendent, she added, noting that the upcoming election could change the face of the school committee, and possibly the outcome of the negotiation.Yarmouth resident Vida Morris pointed to the administrations handling of former Mattacheese Middle School teacher John Tierneys inappropriate relationship with a student as a reason not to extend the contract: Just because the affair didnt rise the level of criminal prosecution, does not mean that gross misconduct, did not occur, Morris said.The contract still has to be reviewed by districts attorney, a process school committee member Phillip Morris says will likely take about a week.
