Arsenal celebrated in unison as Danny Welbeck's strike earned a 1-0 win which leaves Norwich's Premier League position ever more precarious The well-publicised protests in the 12th and 78th minute - to signal 12 years since Arsenal's last Premier League title - were a bit like the Gunners' seasonLots of expectation, poor execution.And Welbeck gave Arsene Wenger reason for cheer and optimism of an 18th successive season in the Champions League with the decisive goal.The Gunners' clash at Manchester City on May 8 will be crucial in determining their finishing position, while Norwich play at home to Manchester United the previous day desperate for points in their bid to avoid the drop.A small minority took part in the protests and were shouted down by pro-Wenger chantsArguments even broke out between rival factions.There may have been greater agreement had the "Time for change" posters been directed at Giroud, Arsenal's number 12, so abject was his performance.And the decision to send on Welbeck for Alex Iwobi, instead of the Frenchman, was jeered.It was soon justifiedGiroud met Hector Bellerin's cross with a cushioned header which Welbeck drilled into the corner, three minutes after his introduction.Norwich are still without a win at Arsenal since the opening day of the inaugural Premier League season in August 1992They have won two of their last 15 league games, with 11 defeats.Alex Neil's side dropped beneath Newcastle and Sunderland prior to kick-off, when a side showing five changes aimed to respond to the 3-0 loss to the Black Cats.Norwich started wellNathan Redmond forced Petr Cech to save after five minutes, after a Martin Olsson cross evaded everyone.Cameron Jerome blasted over before arguments broke out between Arsenal supporters disputing the future of their club."There's only one Arsene Wenger" rang around the Emirates Stadium as the 12th-minute protest took place.There was indecision off the field and on it, as Arsenal dithered around the Norwich penalty area, failing to fashion any real chances.A deflected Mohamed Elneny effort resulted in a corner and Laurent Koscielny headed over.Gary O'Neil had an opportunity on the break, exchanged passes with Redmond, but miscued his shot spectacularly over.Redmond, Norwich's most lively player, made space for a shot which skipped wide.Then came Welbeck's introduction, immediately injecting energy, and Arsenal's goal.Redmond tried to create an equaliser, crossing for substitute Dieumerci Mbokani, but Gabriel - on for the injured Per Mertesacker - timed his intervention brilliantly.Alexis Sanchez shot straight at John Ruddy from a Mesut Ozil pass on the counter attack.The Germany playmaker then volleyed over before Elneny brought the ball down on his chest and fired with the outside of his bootRuddy saved.The goalkeeper ventured forward in stoppage time, but Norwich's free-kick barely reached him as they suffered another damaging defeat. TWEET OF THE MATCH
"Well done to all you Arsenal fans who never held them silly embarrassing protest boards upThe minority ones who did.Have a word!! #AFC" - Former Arsenal striker John Hartson (@JohnHartson10) had some strong words on fans protesting before the gamePLAYER RATINGSArsenalPetr Cech: 6 (out of 10)Hector Bellerin: 7Per Mertesacker: 5Laurent Koscielny: 6Nacho Monreal: 5Mohamed Elneny: 6Aaron Ramsey: 7Mesut Ozil: 7Alex Iwobi: 6Alexis Sanchez: 6Olivier Giroud: 5SubstitutesGabriel (for Mertesacker, 51): 6Danny Welbeck (for Iwobi, 56): 7Francis Coquelin (for Sanchez, 84): 5NorwichJohn Ruddy: 7Ivo Pinto: 5Russell Martin: 5Sebastien Bassong: 5Martin Olsson: 5Jonny Howson: 6Gary O'Neil: 6Nathan Redmond: 7Cameron Jerome: 5Wes Hoolahan: 5Robbie Brady: 5SubstitutesDieumerci Mbokani (for Hoolahan, 68): 5Steven Naismith (for Brady, 77): 5Matt Jarvis (for Bassong, 89): 5STAR PLAYERWelbeckChanged the game, scoring three minutes after his introduction off the bench.MOMENT OF THE MATCHThe 12th-minute protest prompted arguments among pro- and anti-change factionsThe debate continues.VIEW FROM THE BENCHMany thought Giroud should have been taken off for Welbeck, but Wenger's decision to replace Iwobi instead was justified when the Frenchman laid on the goalArsenal had been unchanged for the third straight game, while Neil made five changes following the loss to Sunderland, with Pinto, Martin, Hoolahan, Jerome and Redmond drafted inThe changes failed to inspire the Canaries, who still seemed short of ideas.MOAN OF THE MATCHThe 12th minute "Time for change" posters could have been aimed at Arsenal's number 12, Giroud, who was poor, apart from the assist for Welbeck's goal.WHO'S UP NEXTManchester City v Arsenal (Barclays Premier League, Sunday, May 8)Norwich v Manchester United (Barclays Premier League, Saturday, May 7)
