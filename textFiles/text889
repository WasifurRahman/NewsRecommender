Have your say
Entries are rolling in for Banchory Rotary Clubs Vintage Car and Motorcycle Rally which will take place at Milton of Crathes on Sunday, May 29.
More than 200 entries have been received from all over Scotland and organisers are confident that final numbers will be close to last years record of 300 vintage, classic and collectors cars and motor cycles.
It is very well organised and we always enjoy it
Robbie Gordon
Exhibitor
The annual rally, now in its 20th year, has raised thousands of pounds for both local and national charities over the years.
The main beneficiary this year will be Banchory Sports Village.
Rotarian Harry McNab, who is chairman of the organising committee, said: We are delighted that EFC Group, a major player in the oil in the global oil and gas industry, is supporting the event for the fifth year running as main sponsor and we look forward to the local community rallying round to support a local charity which has exciting plans to develop the Banchory Sports Village.Also looking forward to the event is veteran exhibitor, Robbie Gordon from Alford, who has seldom missed the rally and is a regular winner. Last year, he was runner-up for the top award with his 1929 Chrysler which he has won frequently with in the past.However, the car has now been sold and this year he has entered an even older car, his wife Joyces 1924 Cluley, one of only 10 in the country from the original 881 manufactured by Clarke Cluley and Co in Coventry between 1920 and 1927.
Mr Gordon said: The Crathes rally is the first of the season and one of the best in the North-east. It is very well organised and we always enjoy it.Classes in the rally will feature vintage (pre-1930), post vintage (1931-39) and five collectors classes (1940-61, 1962-69, 1970-1980, 1981-95 and 1996 to present). There are also classes for Automobiles of America and best motor cycle.Closing date for entries is Friday, May 13.
