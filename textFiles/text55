LeeAnne Locken Slams Cary Deuber For Carny Diss: You Dont Effing Know Me, B***h!.

The Mouth of the South has struck again! After feuding with Brandi Redmond over her inappropriate behavior at charity events, LeeAnne Locken warned Cary Deuber and Stephanie Hollman to steer clear of their rule-breaking friend!
On this weeks The Real Housewives of Dallas, Locken continued to blast Redmond for wearing a hat covered in fake dog poop to a charity event.
I feel sorry for her daughters, Locken told her friend Tiffany Hendra of Redmonds children. I dont know how those girls are going to grow up. It wont be with class.
After disagreeing with Lockens grudge over the situation, Hendra decided to reach out to Deuber and Hollman to have a friendship with her other co-stars.

But the idea didnt sit well with Locken, especially since Deuber and Hollman are good friends with her enemy Redmond.
Brandis actions are reflecting on them, Locken said in her confessional. If Tiffany truly wants to become friendly with these women then I need to step in and help make these girls understand the rules.
Locken then decided to invite Deuber and Hollman out to lunch to discuss their reputations, but insisted to Hendra there would be no drama at the meeting.
Hendra quipped, LeeAnne saying she doesnt like drama is like Charlie Sheen saying he doesnt like hookers!

And Hendra was right, as the get-together turned into catfight.
Locken brought the fake poop and negative articles from the event.
S**t is not appropriate at charity events, Locken said, as Deuber jabbed in her confessional, She brought props and handouts to lunch. Are we seriously having a meeting about this right now?
When Deuber explained how she doesnt care about what other people think of her, Locken fired back, Thats being appropriate though Cary!
Deuber then explained how Locken is too concerned with being accepted by the charity community.
Locken responded, If you bow at me, I will bow back. If Im being a b***h then Im going to sharpen my tongue and put you in a little puddle. Bow at me. See how it goes. I dont give a f**k.

But Deuber didnt back down, as she explained how Locken isnt high society because she grew up in the carnival circuit.
Why are you trying to act like this Dallas socialite? You have to be born into that, Deuber said, as Locken responded, You dont actually.
When Deuber said how she didnt want to fight, Locken fired back before storming off, Im not fighting with you. If you think this is a fight, you dont effing know me b***h!

Also on the episode, Redmond opened up about her marital issues with her husband Bryan.
After complaining about how he is always traveling for work, Redmond decided to go to a strip club with Hollman and Deuber to get white girl wasted.
Instead of enjoying a lap dance of her own, Redmond jumped onstage and gave the stripper one instead!
But when her husband found out about the outing, he fought with his wife over her behavior.
I made the mistake of telling Bryan everything that happened at the strip club, she said in her confessional. My husband Bryan and I used to party all the time and now he gets pissed when I do. We kind of live separate lives now.
When Bryan returned home from a business trip, Redmond explained how they are barely speaking.
Bryan feels like he has an image to protect with his business, she said in her confessional. He doesnt want his wife at a strip club.
Redmond then explained how she doesnt understand what happened to the loved-up high school sweethearts they once were.
I feel like I hardly know him, Redmond cried. It hurts to feel like youre always giving someone all of you and you dont feel it in return.
