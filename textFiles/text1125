Villaflor Hospital upgrades O.R. Complex
April 24, 2016
Sunday Punch
THE Dagupan Doctors Villaflor Memorial Hospital (DDVMH) on April 19, 2016 inaugurated its state-of-the-art Operating Room Complex with former Health Secretary Enrique T. Ona and Mayor Belen T. Fernandez as guests of honor.
The expansion of the O.R. Complex, with six functionally independent O.R. Suites, optimizes the delivery of all surgical services, from general, laparoscopic and subspecialty surgeries.
The equipment upgrade to modernize surgery, includes modern laparoscopic machines, energy devices, a multispecialty surgical microscope, latest anesthesia machines and cutting-edge rapid transport services of specimens from the O.R. to the Laboratory Department.
It is the first O.R. Complex equipped with UV Germicidal System in the Country. A set of UV Germicidal Lamps is installed inside the air conditioning system to sterilize the air inside the complex. This Clean Air technology ensures that the patient on the operating table receives the cleanest air with minimal airborne bacteria exposure, if not zero.
Coupled with Clean Air Technology is the Sterrad, a low-heat hydrogen peroxide plasma technology for sterilizing instruments efficiently and effectively.
All these advancements seek to improve surgical outcomes, deliver the highest standard of surgical care and ensure patient safety.
The Villaflor Hospital, through this landmark achievement in its history of 48 years, renews its commitment to Deliver the Best Possible Care to Pangasinan and the entire Northern Luzon.
