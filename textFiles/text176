Insights on the French Digital Republic Bill.
ALGORITHMS:France approved a law intended to shed some light in the algorithmic decisions that shape our digital life and rights. The new legislation is examined in depth in this recent article from the LSE blog.
The author indicates that the first shortcoming of the rules comes as early as article 2, which establishes the obligation to communicate therules defining the algorithmic processing, only to the individual who is directly affected by that processing. This means that "Computer scientists or consumer rights associations are therefore not able to speculatively request access to the algorithm, despite having the technical competence to decipher and understand the impact of an algorithm.
In addition, copyright laws might prevent the individual who gained access to the algorithmic functioning from communicating his/her findings to the public.
The article makes the recommendation of an organic approach to algorithmic regulation, one integrated with other laws that affect technology, such as copyright and public sector information.
