Clinton Devon Estates ranger Tom Garner, who is responsible for the wild deer population, said baby roe deer are particularly at risk.Mr Garner explained how human contact could damage the bond between the mother and her offspring.He said: There have been instances where people have attempted to pick-up a young deer or touch it to make sure its okay, but in doing this, theyre leaving their smell on the youngster, which may stop the mother returning to feed it.Its very important that, no matter how tempting it might be to get close, these babies should just be viewed from a distance. We need to ensure that the mother can find her youngster easily and that we keep our wildlife wild.Clinton Devon Estates are supporting the British Deer Societys annual awareness raising campaign.They also want to remind people that dogs must be on leads in areas where deer are likely to be.
