Hello Everyone
I was wondering that you can share your experience of collecting LF-4s, like what's the best way to collecting them, Is it by doing Epsilon gate more and more and more till you get the amount u need? or via buying large amount of Booty keys (e.g. 2400 keys) and collect on the LF4-Day?
why is faster and more efficient?
and roughly could you estimate how much uri does it take to open Epsilon? and I guess that it's not guaranteed to receive LF-4 after it's done (Except for your first attempt), and what's your probabilities if u collect them all through gates?
Thanks a lot
