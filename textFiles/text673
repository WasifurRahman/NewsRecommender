Australia blames refugee advocates after asylum seeker sets herself alightAustralia vow no change to harsh immigration policyImage Credit: ReutersRefugee advocate holds sign to protest against treatment of refugees.Published: 12:36 May 3, 2016 ReutersAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisSydney: Australia blamed refugee advocates on Tuesday for encouraging asylum seekers held in remote camps towards acts of self-harm after a woman set herself on fire, while the United Nations renewed its criticism of Australias harsh immigration policy.Australian officials said an unidentified 21-year-old Somali woman was in a critical condition after she set herself alight at an Australian detention camp on the tiny South Pacific island of Nauru on Monday, the second such incident in a week.A 23-year-old Iranian man also set himself on fire last week in protest against his treatment on Nauru and later died. The Somali woman has been transferred to Australia for treatment, officials said.Under Australias hardline immigration policy, asylum seekers intercepted trying to reach Australia after paying people smugglers are sent for processing to camps on Nauru, which holds about 500 people, and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. They are told they will never be settled in Australia.The Papua New Guinea government ordered the Manus Island camp, which holds about 850 people, closed last week after its Supreme Court ruled the facility unlawful.The harsh conditions and reports of systemic child abuse at the camps have drawn wide criticism inside and outside Australia and have become a major headache for Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during campaigning for likely July elections.Australia however has vowed there will be no change to the policy, which has been pursued by successive governments.On Tuesday, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton acknowledged there had been a rise in cases of self-harm in the camps but accused refugee advocates of giving the asylum seekers false hope they would one day be settled in Australia.Her said some advocates were encouraging some of these people to behave in a certain way.The recent behaviours in Nauru are not protests against living conditions. They arent protests against health care, they arent protests against the lack of financial support, Dutton told a news conference in Canberra.However, the peak UN body for refugees said such incidents in the camps, which hold asylum seekers fleeing violence in the Middle East, Afghanistan and South Asia, were a result of Australias tough offshore detention polices.These people have already been through a great deal, many have fled war and persecution, some have already suffered trauma, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Australia said in a statement.The consensus among medical experts is that conditions of detention and offshore processing do immense damage to physical and mental health, it said.A boat believed to be carrying asylum seekers from Sri Lanka had been intercepted near the remote Australian Indian Ocean territory of the Cocos Islands, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported later on Tuesday.If confirmed to be carrying asylum seekers, it would be the first such vessel to have arrived in Australian territory in almost two years.A spokeswoman for Duttons office refused to confirm or deny such a vessel had been intercepted.The number of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia is small compared with those arriving in Europe, but border security has long been a major political issue and will almost certainly feature prominently again in elections likely to be held in July.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from Australia Australia prepares for carp-aggedon 01:43 pmAdvocates abetting refugee suicides?12:36 pmSyrian-Australian suspect arrested in Lebanon$45 for a packet of cigarettes 03:06 pmFrench PM vows to supervise sub deal himselfAnger at plans to cull Australias brumbiesCraig Wright: I am Bitcoin creatorAustralia readies key election budget tags from this storyIranfollow this tag on MGNAfghanistanfollow this tag on MGNSri Lankafollow this tag on MGNAustraliafollow this tag on MGNUnited Nationsfollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsNewsAsiaAustraliatagsIranfollow this tag on MGN+MGNAfghanistanfollow this tag on MGN+MGNSri Lankafollow this tag on MGN+MGNAustraliafollow this tag on MGN+MGNUnited Nationsfollow this tag on MGN+MGNAlso In AustraliaImpossibly rare violet diamond found 					Framed Gallery Shiite pilgrims converge on Baghdad shrineUS cruise in decades docks in Havana
