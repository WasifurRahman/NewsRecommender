Meet Kristin
My name is Kristin and I am a coupon addict. My coupon addiction feeds my other addiction, Disney. How are the two related you ask? Well I have learned how to use the money I save by couponing to pay for my yearly trips to Disney World. And I am eager to share that knowledge with all of you!
