Boeing 747-8 To Serve As Next Generation Air Force One
1/29/2015 6:01 AM ET
Boeing 747-8 will serve as the next US presidential aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One.Air Force News Service reported that Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, in coordination with Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition, technology and logistics Frank Kendall, selected Boeing 747-8 ahead of Airbus A380, the only two companies that manufacture four-engine, wide-body platforms that could meet the requirements of the Air Force One mission. The next generation of Presidential airplane, due to enter service in 2017, will replace the two-engine Boeing VC-25."The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that), when fully missionized, meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission," according to James.The decision authorizes the US Air Force to purchase the commercial aircraft, and award a sole-source contract to Boeing for the modification of the 747-8. Discussions with Boeing will likely lead to a contract for the aircraft platform as well as the modifications necessary to conform to the Air Force One mission, Air Force officials said."This decision is not a contract award to procure 747-8 aircraft," said Col. Amy McCain, the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program manager. "We still need to finalize the overall acquisition strategy and conduct risk-reduction activities with Boeing to inform the engineering and manufacturing development contract negotiations that will define the capabilities and cost," he added.James said it is time to upgrade the current fleet of VC-25 presidential aircraft, which she said "has performed exceptionally well".
She said the Air Force is seeking a successor to VC-25 mainly due to "Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased down times for maintenance.""The Air Force provides the president with safe and reliable air transportation with high levels of security and communication capability as the alternate airborne White House," she added. "This platform will meet the requirements necessary to provide that level of service for future presidents," James said of Boeing 747-8.The Secretary made it clear that affordability will be a key element of the procurement program. The new aircraft will replace a presidential fleet that consisted of two Boeing VC-25As - specifically configured, highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft that was delivered during the presidency of George HW Bush in 1990.The presidential aircraft is one of the most visible symbols of the United States and the office of the US President. Capable of refueling midair, Air Force One has unlimited range and can carry the President wherever he needs to travel at short notice. Air Force One is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States.The President and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the President. Air Force One includes a medical suite that can function as an operating room.The "Air Force One" call sign was created after a 1953 incident during which a Lockheed Constellation named Columbine II carrying President Dwight D. Eisenhower entered the same airspace as a commercial airline flight using the same call sign.A number of aircraft types have been used as Air Force One since the creation of the presidential fleet, starting with the 3 Lockheed Constellations in the late 1950s. Two Boeing 707s were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s. by RTT Staff WriterFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.comBusiness News
