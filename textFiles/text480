Gratitude in achievement
May 03, 2016, 05:00 AM By Jonathan Madison
An age-old biblical passage in the book of James 4:34 states: One sows and another reaps. I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor. The passage speaks to a humbling truth
that while many of us take great pride in our accomplishments, the fact remains that we have not independently accomplished anything. Allow me to elaborate.
Last Wednesday marked the last day of my law school career. For many of my fellow law students, it was a time of great celebration and earned recognition of their accomplishment. As for me, it was a time of deep reflection.
I was mindful that I could not take full credit for completing my journey through law school or any other effort in life. As many of us can attest, our accomplishments in life are in large part attributed to the hard-earned effort of someone who either supported us or who came before us. For example, although I am a first generation law school graduate, the support to complete such an endeavor was only made possible by the efforts of my parents, each of whom worked two to three jobs to support my siblings and me.
I have come to learn that our lives are like clay constantly molded by the people and changing circumstances around us. Witnessing my mother and father work tirelessly to provide basic necessities for my siblings and I taught me the value of hard work. Beyond their tireless work ethic, they instilled a foundation of scrupulous values for which I have and will always embrace. My brother instilled a competitive drive in me through his love and commitment to the game of baseball. My sister taught me the value of studying tirelessly to achieve academic success and so much more in life.
While I am thankful for the family and loved ones who have supported me in life, I am equally thankful for the prior generations who labored before me to make my dreams a reality, even though they were not aware of my future existence.
My grandfather was a well-known carpenter in his community and a proud Vietnam veteran. His father worked tirelessly to provide a basic means by which to support my grandfather and his future endeavors. Of course, my ancestors labored through more than four centuries of involuntary servitude for the mere opportunity to live as free citizens within our nation. Without the efforts of every generation, my ability to obtain a law school degree would be all but impossible. As such, my law school degree belongs in part to everyone who has supported me in life, as well as those who supported the possibility of my efforts before my own existence.
While being mindful of the labor that others have made on our behalf, we should also be mindful that the labor you and I make on a daily basis is for the benefit of someone in a future generation, regardless of whether it is a child, grandchild or descendant we will never meet. That is how important our daily choices and habits truly are. Everything you and I do has an effect on future generations.
Given that graduation season is upon us, I would like to dedicate this column two fold. First, I would like to congratulate the hardworking parents of San Mateo who are about to witness their sons and daughters graduate from educational institutions. Second, I would like to congratulate the graduates of 2016. Your accomplishment is only one of many to come.
Let us remember during graduation season to take a moment and acknowledge the hard-earned efforts of those who supported us in life as well as those who supported us in prior generations.
