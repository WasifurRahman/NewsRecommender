N.C. lawmaker sued as farm workers claim some wages unpaid.

Seven Mexican farm laborers are suing a North Carolina legislator, claiming they weren't paid wages due from working on the lawmaker's crops.The lawsuit filed last month on behalf of the foreign field hands seeks class-action status and compensation for more than 50 who worked at state Sen. Brent Jackson's Autryville farm. The farm hands were hired in Mexico to work on Jackson's farm under a federal program that allows imported temporary labor when local workers can't be found.Lawyers for the Sampson County Republican responded in court documents that all wages were paid and workers submitted false time reports or records.Jackson is one of the General Assembly's few farmers and has received financial backing from agribusiness contributors. His farm operations grow sweet potatoes, melons, broccoli, cucumbers and tobacco.
