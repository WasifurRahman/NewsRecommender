Getty images to file an antitrust complaint against Google in Europe for scraping
ANTITRUST: US Photo Agency Getty is rumored to be preparing filing a complaint before the EU Commission against Google this week. The accusation is that Google images abuses its dominant position in images searches scraping Getty's photographs and causing a significant drop in traffic from Gettys paid-for website.
Scraping is one of the Commissions antitrust concerns in the Google case, and it consists in using original content from rivals to promote Googles services. Similar complaints had so far been raised particularly by travel websites with regard to reviews.
In the complaint Getty specifies that since 2013 the images from their archives shown in google.com and google.co.uk image search drastically improved in quality, deterring users from proceeding to the Getty paid-for platform. "However, traffic remained robust on the French and German Google sites, which did not implement the display changes in January 2013. Getty's general counsel Yoko Miyashita said that in this way Google promoted piracy, resulting in widespread copyright infringement, turning users into accidental pirates.
According to Getty, Google answered their concerns denying antitrust practices, and suggesting that Getty opts out of image search.
The EU Commission has so far elected to not proceed with charges of scraping against Google, but additional complaints might change their decision.
