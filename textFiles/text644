Checking out the
Asthma Awareness week stand on Stafford St on Tuesday are from left Luca Fassbender, 3, with his mum Jaclyn Smith, and asthma nurse educator Vicki Lyford.
Up to 70 per cent of Kiwi asthmatics do not take their medications as directed, a problem being highlighted on Asthma Awareness Day.One in nine adults and one is seven children suffer from asthma throughout New Zealandwith 52 deaths from the respiratory conditioneach year, the Asthma+ Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand said.Asthma South Canterbury nurse educator Vicki Lyford said compliance, when it came to medication, was a major problem.It was often down to forgetfulness or the person felt OK and thought they did not need it, Lyford said.Asthma wascaused by the small airways (the bronchioles)in the lungs becomingirritated and swollen.The muscles surrounding the bronchiole walls narrow. Excess mucous also restrictedair travelling, making breathing difficult.Preventers worked inside the airways to stop swelling and prevent mucus and it worked in 12-hourblocks."The full benefit is not realised if it is not taken morning and night," she said.Though anew preventer medication introduced to the marketin March reduced dosage to onedaily use, Lyford said it depended on what was prescribed what asthmatics needed to follow.Relievers were taken when an asthmatic felt short of breath and worked on the outside of the airways to stop the restriction to the lungs.New Zealand has one of the highest rates of asthma in the world but South Canterbury was on a par with the rest of the country, Lyford said.

Because South Canterbury had a high elderly population there were a "fair few"people sufferingchronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Theprogressive disease was caused by smoking or other substances such as asbestos inhalation and was characterised by shortage of breath.To raise awareness of asthma and other respiratory conditions,Lyford manned a display table and answered questions from the publicon Stafford St on Tuesday.
