Westerly Library to get new look with renovations
Westerly Library to get new look with renovations

WESTERLY
The Westerly Library is undergoing some minor yet major renovations, according to Library Executive Director Brigitte Hopkins, and while no walls are being constructed or torn down, the changes should be significant.
Its going to be amazing and greatly improve the use of the library for both patrons and staff, said Hopkins noting that the changes are being made based on feedback from patrons, staff in addition to action items related to the librarys most recent strategic plan and some focus on the way people gather, learn, and play.

Hopkins said by making the small but significant improvements in the layout and usability of its spaces, the library will be able to better serve the needs of its users.
Plans call for the installation of a new circulation desk; the relocation of the information desk from its current location to an equally prominent location in the new computer room and the creation of a Makerspace to provide teenage patrons with a room dedicated to their needs.
The need to create dedicated space for computers, technology, and technology instruction is vital to successful lifelong learning, Hopkins said, noting that two departments and adjacent spaces will be rearranged to include the creation of a dedicated teen room, computer lab, technology space.
Hopkins said about six years ago the library underwent an expansive interior renovation that vastly improved the functionality and aesthetics of the library interiors.
Since then, she said, the library has exploded, and seen an enormous increase in the number of cardholders, services, and library programming.
In addition, she added, the demand on the teen space has more than tripled.
Westerly Library and Wilcox Park strives to remain on the forefront of innovation and inspiration said Hopkins. We are thrilled to be making these changes as we feel that these improvements are imperative to the success of our organization and enhance our ability to deliver better user experience. We hope that our users will be equally excited and find the spaces improve their use of the library.
The renovations are bing made thanks to the generosity of The Champlin Foundations, Hopkins said.
