Colorado supreme court lifts local bans on fracking
By Rick Moran
Great news for the Colorado economy and residents who need cheaper energy alternatives.
The Colorado Supreme court has lifted local bans on fracking in several cities, opening the door for an energy boom.
Washington Times:
Dan Haley, president and CEO of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association, which challenged the bans in court, called the decision not just a win for the energy industry but for the people of Colorado who rely on affordable and dependable energy and a strong economy.
It sends a strong message to anyone trying to drive this vital industry out of the state that those efforts will not be tolerated at any level, Mr. Haley said in a statement.
Meanwhile, opponents of fracking decried the ruling, saying it flies in the face of a communitys ability to safeguard its health.
Todays decision deals a devastating blow not just to Longmont residents, but to all Coloradans who have been stripped of a democratic process that should allow us the right to protect our health, safety and property from the impacts of this dangerous industrial activity, said Lauren Petrie, Rocky Mountain region director with Food & Water Watch.
Colorado moved to the center of the anti-fracking movement with measures approved by voters in a half-dozen communities, primarily liberal college towns with little or no energy-industry ties, to stop oil and gas development, starting with the fracking ban added to the Longmont city charter in 2012.
Applying well-established preemption principles, we conclude that an operational conflict exists between Longmonts fracking bans and applicable state law, said thecourts decision. Accordingly, we hold that Article XVI is preempted by state law and, therefore, is invalid and unenforceable.
Environmentalists have attempted for several years to place an anti-fracking measure on the statewide ballot, so far without success. Several signature-gathering efforts that would allow communities to halt oil and gas development within their borders are underway.
The measures have been opposed by Colorado Republicans and Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, a former geologist who famously drank fracking fluid to demonstrate its safety.
Fracking foes said the ruling would galvanize their campaigns to qualify initiatives for the November ballot.
In a politically motivated decision, thecourtagreed with Governor Hickenlooper in ruling that were not allowed to protect our backyards and schoolyards from fracking. This is shameful, said Food & Water Watch Colorado in a statement. And its exactly why we need to pass the Coloradans Resisting Extreme Energy Development ballot measures this November.
Protect their "backyards and schoolyards" from what exactly? There has been no demonstrated direct link between the fracking process and contaminated ground water. There have been several instances of negligent mishandling of the toxic wastewater that seeped into groundwater. But the process itself has been demonstrated as safe.
Reasonable regulation and oversight of fracking sites is required. But the process itself has been deemed safe even by the EPA. The green's hysteria over fracking has no basis in science or in our experience, and is one more indication that their true agenda is to make energy prohibitively expensive for ordinary Americans.
