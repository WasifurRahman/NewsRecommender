Ezeife, PPA leader reject grazing land bill.
Reactions have continued to trail the grazing land bill currently before the National Assembly with the latest coming from the former Governor of Anambra State, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife and the leader of Progressive Peoples Alliance, PPA in the state, Mr Godwin Ezeemo who is also an agriculturist, rejecting the bill in its totality. According to Ezeife it is an evil bill that will only benefit the Fulani herdsmen and not the entire Nigerians . Reacting during a special thanksgiving church service by Dr Levy C. Monanu, for successful completion of tenure as Anambra State chairman ,Christian Pilgrim Welfare Board and public presentation of LeviticalEye health foundation at Igboukwu, Ezeife said, we pray God to direct the Fulanis so that they can behave well He stated that, Fulanis need the country more than any other nation because they are educationally backward and poor.
It is Huvery unfortunate and painful that the people who need Nigeria most are the people destroying it by clashing with farmers, (landowners) in the name of grazing and the farmers are being slaughtered on daily basis because they dont want their cattle to damage their crops How many educated and rich people do they have, they collect money from government. We pray God to direct the leadership of Fulani to leave our people alone. I do not believe that President Muhamadu Buhari is very alert to what is going on around him on the Fulani killing and I know that those around him are competent people that advise him well. I can say I have given up on Buhari, only God can now save the Igbo. We call on all Nigerians to pray to take Buhari to the right part for one Nigeria. In his own contribution, Ezeemo stated that states Houses of Assembly should enact a law forbidding grazing in their various states and possibly go for cattle ranch which he said is more profitable.
