Ezeife, PPA leader reject grazing land bill
Ezeife, PPA leader reject grazing land bill
Posted By: Gloria Anaezeon: May 03, 2016In: Highlights1 Comment Print Email
Facebook0Twitter0Google+0LinkedIn1Reactions have continued to trail the grazing land bill currently before the National Assembly with the latest coming from the former Governor of Anambra State, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife and the leader of Progressive Peoples Alliance, PPA in the state, Mr Godwin Ezeemo who is also an agriculturist, rejecting the bill in its totality. According to Ezeife it is an evil bill that will only benefit the Fulani herdsmen and not the entire Nigerians . Reacting during a special thanksgiving church service by Dr Levy C. Monanu, for successful completion of tenure as Anambra State chairman ,Christian Pilgrim Welfare Board and public presentation of LeviticalEye health foundation at Igboukwu, Ezeife said, we pray God to direct the Fulanis so that they can behave well He stated that, Fulanis need the country more than any other nation because they are educationally backward and poor.
It is Huvery unfortunate and painful that the people who need Nigeria most are the people destroying it by clashing with farmers, (landowners) in the name of grazing and the farmers are being slaughtered on daily basis because they dont want their cattle to damage their crops How many educated and rich people do they have, they collect money from government. We pray God to direct the leadership of Fulani to leave our people alone. I do not believe that President Muhamadu Buhari is very alert to what is going on around him on the Fulani killing and I know that those around him are competent people that advise him well. I can say I have given up on Buhari, only God can now save the Igbo. We call on all Nigerians to pray to take Buhari to the right part for one Nigeria. In his own contribution, Ezeemo stated that states Houses of Assembly should enact a law forbidding grazing in their various states and possibly go for cattle ranch which he said is more profitable.

The attack has always been on Christians. Checks all the States where they had attacked including that of Kaduna State. In kaduna it has always been at Southern Kaduna. I like what is going on in Nigeria today. Now we have indigenous people of Middle Belt forum, co-ordinating from Jos. They even replied the so called Northern Governors forum over their recent defence of Fulani Herdsmen on attack at Agatu. It would be recalled that middle Belt soldiers fought the civil war for so called Nigeria. Today where are the development at the land of Middle Belt? How are they recognized among One North which were deceived to belong? In the recent past, the Indigenous people of Biafra has been agitating for and wanting to be on their own. Now the Middle Belt zone has come up with the Indigenous people of Middle Belt forum. The injustice is spreading. The Killing by the Fulani Herdsmen is aimed at conquering the Christians dominated states in Nigeria. We are watching.
