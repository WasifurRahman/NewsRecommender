Friend's dominance is discussed in therapy.

Dear Amy: I am a woman in my late 60s who has had a friend for more than 40 years. Many years ago I was in a powerful position with an organization and encouraged her to apply for a job with the company. She worked for several years in various administrative roles (never reporting directly to me) and was a very good employee, as well as a good friend.We stayed friends even after she moved away. I'd always invite her to join my friends and me at all my parties and ticketed events. She and I even traveled on several trips together.I sensed her distancing herself, but I didn't push it.Last year I had a short visit with her. I thought we had a decent time.Then, about two weeks later she called and told me something her therapist had told her to tell me -- that she didn't like to travel with me because I was too bossy.I told her I thought hers was an easy problem to solve; we just don't need to travel together. I then tried to find out if there was anything else bothering her about me, and she said no. I tried to be calm and remain friendly. We seemed to end the conversation on a good note, but since that time I've not heard from her at all.I am confused and hurt. I'd like to let her know how hurt and angry I am about her complete dismissal of me and our friendship after all these years. I believe she owes me an explanation.What do you think I should do? -- UpsetDear Upset: Generally, when someone tells you she has discussed your relationship in therapy, it's not a good sign. In this case, your friend told you that you are too bossy for her and you responded immediately by telling her you could solve her problem in a way that seems -- if not bossy, then definitely dominant.The response she might have been hoping for would NOT be, "You have a problem. I can solve it," but, "Oh, let me examine my own behavior and see if I can change it."
