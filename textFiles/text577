I am very pleased that the town hall is now back where it belongs, in the ownership of the people of Seaton. We must now all work together to make sure the building is a big success for all concerned.I thank everyone involved in what has been a long process for their commitment and effort. It has shown the advantages of working together to a common goal.Councillor Ian Thomas, portfolio holder for finance at East Devon District Council, said: We are delighted that the transfer of this significant asset to Seaton Town Council has now been completed and confident that the new owners will secure its long-term future within the local community.My colleagues and I will continue to support the town council and its tenants, during the finalisation of the tenant lease agreements, to do all we can to make sure the transfer is successful on all levels.I should like to add personal thanks to all from Seaton Town Council, Seatons Voice, Seaton Museum and my East Devon District Council members and officer colleagues, for their positive approach and commitment to delivering this important transfer.Seaton Town Hall is a prominent building the town can be proud of and, with new tenants, The Seaton Gateway Theatre Company and Seaton Museum, the town council says it is looking forward to an exciting future ahead.
