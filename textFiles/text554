Warming trend through the weekend
Warm and dry through week's end.
By Meteorologist Mark Larson&nbsp|&nbsp
Posted: Tue 6:25 AM, May 03, 2016
Meteorologist Mark Larson says much drier, warmer weather will take us through week's end.
Look for decreasing clouds Tuesday with light winds for the east and a fresh northwest wind across western Kansas.
Highs will top-out in the 60s and 70s.
A shifting, midweek weather pattern, will bring a wealth of warmth to Kansas and the central Plains. Skies will be sunny with highs around 80 degrees Wednesday then climb into the lower 80s Thursday and Friday.
A Mother's Day weekend storm system will be moving into Kansas bringing gusty winds, more humidity and chances for storms to our area by Sunday.
