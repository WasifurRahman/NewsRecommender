WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH)
Wichita is known as the air capital, and one of Wichita's biggest employers is asking for a big investment.
Spirit AeroSystems says this is all about making Wichita competitive in a global market. It says it is a practice they've been doing with the city since 2005, and hope for it to continue. Spirit is asking for $280 million worth of Industrial Revenue Bonds over the next 5 years.
These are a financing tool issued by the city. Spirit says there is no cost to Wichita, and no risk because the city doesn't back the bonds, they just issue them.
Spirit says its presence helps Wichita, paying millions in taxes every year. It says these bonds help them stay successful.
"We've been doing this for years and it's encouraged a lot of investment on our behalf in this facility, and a lot of job growth," Debbie Gann, Spirit's Vice President of Communications said.
Spirit says this is good business for the city too.
"In 2005 when we were created we had about 7300 employees, today we have about 10,800," Gann said. "So clearly the investment has paid a return to the city and to the company, it's good for all of us."
A study conducted by Wichita State predicts Wichita will see a 5 to 1 return on this investment. Spirit will make its case to Wichita city council members this morning.
