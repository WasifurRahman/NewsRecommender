Children's laureates condemn primary school Sats
14:28
Tuesday 03 May 2016
Two children's laureates have hit out at school tests which they warn are leaving six and seven-year-olds stressed and in tears.
Children across England downed their pencils and missed school on Tuesday in protest at the controversial Sats exams.
Parents across England are planning to keep their children off school in protest over tests for six- and seven-year-olds
It comes after more than 40,000 people signed a petition supporting a boycott of Year 2 Sats by teachers.
The Let Our Kids Be Kids campaign organised the day of action in protest at children being "over-tested, over-worked and in a school system that places more importance on test results and league tables than children's happiness and joy of learning".
Children's laureate Chris Riddell and his predecessor Michael Rosen added their voices to the protest, warning that youngsters are being tested on complicated grammar that risks crushing their love of learning.In an open letter to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan published in The Guardian, Mr Rosen said children are going through "hell" with testing.
Two schoolgirls hold a sign as parents hold a rally in Preston Park, Brighton, in protest at controversial Sats tests for six and seven-year-olds.
He wrote:
"One ex-headteacher and now school governor wrote to tell me of 'six to seven-year-old pupils who, during the testing period, were crying, visibly shaking and reportedly waking up at 4am unable to sleep'. "Any parent of children undergoing these tests has seen how it works. Children sit in school or at home with pre-tests.
Then teachers, children or parents mark these tests and we see the looks on our children's faces as we mark this or that question with a zero.
"The child is wrong. It's a fail. And no matter how kind and encouraging we are, it's still a fail. And another fail. And another."He said children "are not receptacles or cars or machines" but "humans with views of what they are learning and how they feel".
Schoolgirls join the protest against controversial Sats tests for six and seven-year-olds.
Mr Riddell joined hundreds of parents and children at a demonstration in Brighton, where fun and educational activities were laid on to show ministers schooling does not have to be all textbooks and tests.He told the Press Association: "My feeling is there should be more trust in teachers and their ability to assess children at this age rather than through testing.
"The children are being put under undue stress and my argument is, what is the value of what comes from this testing? I think it is questionable."He added: "We should be turning children into readers with the pleasure that gives rather than relying on a testing culture."
Parents hold a rally with their children in Preston Park, Brighton, in protest at tests for six and seven-year-olds.
Sats are taken by children aged six or seven in Year Two and then again in Year Six, aged 10 or 11, before a third set in Year Nine, aged 13 or 14.Parents and teachers have warned that a "hothousing" culture is seeping into primary school classrooms which has left children stressed and put off school.The say the relentless focus on grammar and maths has been to the exclusion of wider and equally important experiences and subjects such as the arts.
Ben Ramalingam, from Brighton, kept his five-year-old son off school.He told the Press Association: "Our kids are being left disengaged and stressed. Kids who previously loved school are now refusing to go."There are a number of people who are saying this has the potential to turn into not just an educational crisis, but a mental health crisis."
Schoolchildren place placards, as parents hold a rally with their children in Preston Park, Brighton, agisnst tests for six and seven-year-olds.
He said there is no proof that testing improves educational attainment, and that many countries who take a more relaxed approach to assessments perform better in international education league tables.He added: "There is an experiment being run on our children and there is no proof it works. It is really inappropriate and, I think, unethical to do it."We are concerned parents taking a stand, we don't want our kids to be stressed out by the time they become teenagers because they have been inappropriately taught. Our children are being pushed towards rote-based learning."It is like something out of Charles Dickens."The Government defended Sats, insisting a strong grasp of English and maths is crucial to a child's prospects.Schools minister Nick Gibb said: "These tests are vital in helping schools to ensure that young children are learning to read, write and add up well."The truth is, if they don't master literacy and numeracy early on, they risk being held behind and struggling for the rest of their lives."
