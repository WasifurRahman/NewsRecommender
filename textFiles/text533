Tasmania's runaway economy will get an added boost from small business incentives outlined in the federal budget, Premier Will Hodgman says.However there are no cheers from the state's Liberal administration when it comes to planned education and health funding from Canberra.With some of Australia's worst literacy and numeracy rates, along with an ageing population, Tasmania had hoped the federal government would channel greater funds south to help manage the increasing burdens."At this stage it appears funding for education, health and the GST is broadly in line with expectations for the coming year," Mr Hodgman said in a statement on Tuesday evening."We are still working through the finer details and we will make further comment as appropriate."First-term premier Mr Hodgman was quick to champion the budget's benefits for small to medium-sized companies, which includes a tax rate cut for businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million, plus access to tax concessions."Small businesses are one of our state's largest employers, with an estimated 36,800 small businesses employing about 100,000 Tasmanians," he said."Importantly, many of these jobs are in regional areas, with two in five small businesses located outside our city centres."The apple isle's economy is growing at its fastest rate in six years, with particular booms in tourism, hospitality and some agricultural sectors.But parts of the state are still suffering from poor employment rates as jobs are lost as a result of downturns in the traditional mining, logging and manufacturing industries.Mr Hodgman tipped his hat to infrastructure spending including scores of millions of dollars for road upgrades and rail works, which he said will provide jobs.Some 40,000 Tasmanians will benefit from proposed changes to income tax brackets, he added."Instead of up to $14 million in taxes going to Canberra, this money will stay in the pockets of Tasmanians and be spent locally."
