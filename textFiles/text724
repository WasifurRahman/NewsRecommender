I spend a lot of time here complaining about Google, the search results, their penalties, their issues and so forth.
But Google does a ton of good. Can you imagine living without search? Nope.
This morning, I saw this heart warming message from a mother of a severely Autistic 15 year old girl in the
Google Web Search Help forums.
She said that she wanted to "thank Google for their contribution with use of their general technology, mainly their search engine, to my daughters development."
Let me share her message: She is severely Autistic and has a Intellectual disabilty. She is 15 this August 30th
and she has come along way.Lisa first words were when she was 3. Ready steady Go!!! That was it until she was twelve, thanks to some therapy interventions in her school. But in the meantime, from the age of three, she became gifted with Google Technology. You see she was cut-off from a young age and in order to get into her world you have to enter it. Google search engine and access to pictures and video from the web enable her to start the communication process. She picked up words, without being able to say them and visualised them through the Google. For example, she would see "The Wonderpets" on TV (she still does this, but there is a bit of UB40 thrown in there),, her rota memory would visuals the name as a caption and she would "Google it". Doing this she embraced technology and despite being vulnerable and isolated to the world, Google brought the world to her.This is from the 3 years of age to today and she still is doing the same. Google is still coming into her world.I just want to take the opportunity to thank the developers and the operators of this services. Amazing, just amazing.So Google got word of this and they responded "Martin, thanks so much for sharing this with us! I'll send your thanks along to our product team, and in the meantime please share the gif below with your daughter - the Community Team at Google thinks she's awesome!"They also want to send her daughter Google Cardboard.It is so nice to read this.Forum discussion at Google Web Search Help.
