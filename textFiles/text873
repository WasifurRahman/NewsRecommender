Have your say
A Scottish Gran who was attacked and left unconscious in a Thai street gave evidence in court over the horrific ordeal.
Rose Owen, 65, and her family were attacked while on holiday in Thailand, with the attack being caught on CCTV. Rose was severely injured, having to have a build up of fluid in her brain removed after the attack. The Glasgow born woman gave evidence in court in Hua Hin, saying: I still have nightmares. And the headaches. The headaches are there all the time.
I dont know if it will always stay with me, the memory, but for now I have nightmares and it is sad that this has happened to me by a small group of Thai people, people who I love.
Roses son and husband, Lewis and Lewis Junior, were also injured in the attack, suffering head injuries which required stitches. A police spokesman Chaiyakorn Sriladecho said the attack started after the son accidentally bumped into one of the Thai men.He added: The men say they are sorry and that they wouldnt have done this if they werent drunk.Mr and Mrs Owen, who now live in Wenvoe in the Vale of Glamorgan were supposed to be in Thailand for another week, have said they may fly home in the next couple of days.
Lewis Jr is a graphic designer living in Singapore, who said that he only gets to see his family twice a year. He said: Im not going back to Thailand again. Mum and dad wont be either.Never, ever again.DOWNLOAD THE SCOTSMAN APP ON ITUNES OR GOOGLE PLAY
