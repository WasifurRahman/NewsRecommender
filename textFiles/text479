Ospreys are nesting in Northumberland
Photo:
Three pairs of ospreys are now looking after eggs at Kielder Water & Forest Park. They are nesting despite the recent bad weather.
There are video cameras set up at the nests. We now know that inside two of the nests, there are three eggs. Experts say this is great news because one of the pairs is a new coupling.
Last year, the ospreys had a successful season laying a total of 10 eggs and fledging six chicks.
The success of this year will depend on how well the birds incubate the eggs during the cold spell. At the moment, they appear to be sitting tight with minimal exposure of the eggs to the elements.
Its always a pleasure to see a full clutch of three eggs on a nest. With a new partnership on Nest 2 it was possible only two eggs would be produced. The ospreys are taking good care of their eggs in this challenging weather but we hope the suns comes out for the chicks hatching from late May.
