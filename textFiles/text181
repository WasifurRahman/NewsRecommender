Caringo Shows How to Solve Issues of All-Digital Workflows at Streaming Media East
Tweet
AUSTIN, Texas, May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Caringo today announced that VP Marketing Adrian Herrera will present at Streaming Media East, the premier trade show for the business and technology of online video, at the New York Hilton Midtown May 10 at 10:55 a.m. Additionally, as a Gold Sponsor of the event, Caringo will exhibit the latest versions of their products in Booth 114 during the two-day event.
Adrian Herrera will present "Store, Deliver and Archive Content on the Same Servers with Searchable Object Storage for the Cloud Age." In his presentation, Herrera will discuss how the value in a content creator's or service provider's application is determined. "Often measured by how quickly and easily the digital assets they create are delivered to their audience, a poor end-user experience can lead to negative effects including potential loss of viewers, overspending on infrastructure, and misuse of resources. We will show attendees how to solve these issuesradically simplifying content storage and delivery infrastructure while reducing costs," said Herrera. Caringo experts will also be on hand to demonstrate Swarm 8, Searchable Storage for the Cloud Age and FileFly.
Offered as a complete software appliance, Swarm provides a storage platform for data protection, management, organization and searchat massive scale. Users no longer need to migrate data into disparate solutions for long-term preservation, delivery and analysis. Organizations can easily consolidate all files on Swarm, find the data they are looking for quickly, and reduce total cost of ownership by continuously evolving hardware and optimizing use of their resources.
Streaming Media is the only conference and expo dedicated entirely to the business, technology, and content of online video. Attendees can learn from online video experts, try out new products on the expo floor and network with their peers. They can expect to leave with actionable advice and new strategies for moving their businesses forward. More than 100 speakers are presenting in more than 40 sessions, including in-depth workshops, how-to technical sessions, case studies, and panel discussions. Additional information about the event is available at http://www.streamingmedia.com/Conferences/East2016/default.aspx.
