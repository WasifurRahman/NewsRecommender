Australias dollar slid after the central bank cut interest rates to a record, wrong-footing hedge funds betting on the currencys strength, as well as a majority of economists. Hedge funds betting on the currencys gains have outnumbered those expecting declines since the middle of February. Negative rates adopted by central banks in Japan and Europe and waning expectations of interest-rate increases in the U.S. have supported the Aussie. Three Hills Capital Partners Founder Mauro Moretti discusses the outlook for currencies with Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua on "the Pulse."
