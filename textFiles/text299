"With Commvault's built-in deduplication, and snap management capabilities we saw an immediate reduction in our data footprint which will lower storage costs, reduce network traffic and enable us to manage critical data while meeting Disaster Recovery, regulatory and security requirements we previously had difficulty to accomplish," said Joel Maag, technology operations manager, Clinicient. "Commvault's open data platform and key technology partnerships eliminated any concerns we had about vendor lock-in. Integration with providers like Microsoft, Pure Storage and others gives us the flexibility to choose any third-party solution we need to meet business requirements, drive new efficiencies and achieve greater performance in our IT operations."
"After the successful implementation of the Commvault email archive solution it was a logical step to also use Commvault to manage the central backup processes as well," said Andreas Kranabitl, CEO at SPAR ICS. "Thanks to the seamless integration of all modules, all requirements of a modern data management process on one platform were met. The holistic project management and the professional migration managed by the Commvault team allowed us to keep the ambitious time frame and to successfully complete the projects."
Today's announcement of customer additions in Q4 2016 follows the recent release of new innovations to the Commvault Data Platform, which further enable customer choice, help eliminate vendor lock-in, and facilitate increased data portability while extending the platform's value to a larger range of applications and software ecosystems for customers, partners and third-party software developers. The new capabilities represent the latest wave of innovation to the company's integrated solutions portfolio -- which includes the Commvault Data Platform, Commvault Software and Commvault services. The 11th version of Commvault's solution portfoliowas first released in October of 2015.
"We are proud to end the quarter and our fiscal year with strong customer momentum and adoption of the Commvault Data Platform and next generation software," said N. Robert Hammer, chairman, president and CEO of Commvault. "Clearly, organizations across the world have embraced the innovations we have brought to market in the past two quarters and we couldn't be more pleased with the industry reaction.
