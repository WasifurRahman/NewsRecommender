A WOMAN charged with killing her dog on Valentines Day after she hit it over the head with a hammer twice and stabbed it multiple times with a kitchen knife remains in custody after her case was adjourned.
Ebony Eve, 27, pleaded guilty to killing the Shar Pei

Eve, of Frobisher Drive, was remanded in custody for her own safety, and has been due to be sentenced on a number of occasions, but the case has been repeatedly adjourned.
She was due to be sentenced at Swindon Magistrates Court on Wednesday but the hearing did not go ahead.
The case has now been adjourned until Friday, May 6, when she is due to be sentenced. In the meantime she remains in custody.
