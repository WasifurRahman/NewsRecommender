MTV says Ashley Sawyer, who appeared in a 2013 episode of the network's reality show, "Catfish," has died at 23.
MTV News reports Sawyer died over the weekend in Alabama. The cause of death isn't known.
"Catfish" is a series about online scams. The episode that featured Sawyer shows her meeting a longtime digital companion, Michael Fortunato, in person. The pair used altered images of themselves after striking up a conversation in an online chatroom.
MTV News reports Fortunato died at 26 from a pulmonary embolism one month after the episode aired.
In a recent follow-up episode, MTV says Sawyer revealed that she had struggled with addiction.
"Catfish" host Max Joseph has tweeted out his condolences, calling Sawyer "sweet and kind."
