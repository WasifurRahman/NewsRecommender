Who wore the best Chanel at the Met Gala: Kristen Stewart, Lily-Rose or Willow?
May 03, 2016
By Kaiser
Jaden Smith, Jemima Kirke, Kristen Stewart, Lily Rose Depp, Met Gala, Willow Smith
Considering Karl Lagerfelds close relationship with Anna Wintour, I always expect a lot of Chanel on the Met Gala carpet.
But I was not expecting Chanel to be so fking boring this year.
Kristen Stewart is one of the major faces of the House of Chanel these days, and this is how she was styled.
This is what Lagerfeld wants you to think of when you think of Chanel
bad hair, excessive eye makeup and a really boring dress.
Lily-Rose Depp is another Chanel girl, just like her mom.
Lily-Rose is only 16 years old
do you find this inappropriate on someone so young?
Do you find it sort of thirsty?
Because I do.
Plus, it looks like it was made from an old quilt.
Willow Smith and Jaden Smith coordinated their looks
she wore Chanel, he wore Louis Vuitton.
And you know what?
I dont hate the brother-sister Met Gala appearance at all.
I think they look really cool.
Willows Chanel is my favorite Chanel of the night.

I love her outfit but its too mature for her she cant pull it off.
I like Kristens look too, and her makeup is fine for this event. People forget its a costume ball with a theme
its not the Oscars.

Really expected KStewart to bring it She didnt.
Lily Rose is a gorgeous young lady but shes styled like an older lounge singer.
Jaden and Willows relationship is so cute. Also, their locs are growing very nicely.

Look at that big smile on Kristen Stewart! Gawd! That girl is soo beautiful. Even when she looks bad, shes still beautiful. Thats the most unpretentious thing Jaden has worn recently

Kristen shouldnt come to events like this. She clearly couldnt care less. I actually really like Willows outfit but Im not sure I like the jacket overpowers the jumpsuit.

This is one of KStews worst Chanel looks in my opinion
I dont know what her hair stylist and make up artist were thinking with her styling as well.
Willow wins, by a long shot.

I agree. Stewart looked awful. One of the nights worst dressed and styled. I get the feeling little effort or planning went into any of it. Like she probably really wasnt into going, arrived in NY a day ahead, and put her dress on for the first time yesterday. Maybe her makeup and hair people were hung over from the night before and collectively they all said, lets just get this over with.

Kristen looks pretty terrible. The dress makes her look larger than she is and there are no excuses for the makeup.
I dont think Lily-Rose Depps dress is appropriate for her age, but thats the tip of the iceberg of things I think shes too young for.
Smoking, alleged drug use, older boyfriendsI can let the dress slide.
I actually dont hate Willows look at all.

I thought Karl loved Kristen, so not sure why she is wearing a recycled shag carpet. But there we are. And the makeup almost made her unrecognizable.
Lilly Rose went for the poor lounge singer makes outfit from old curtain look. I honestly dont believe that children belong at this event and thats what she is. Its not so much that the look is too old for her, is that she is too young for the occasion.
I also dont think the Smith children belong there either, but what do I know. I am old fashioned and think kids belong in schools and gyms and out with friends their own age, having slushies while riding their bikes, researching colleges and doing chores for pocket money. Maybe baby-sitting or refereeing tikes soccer. That sort of thing.

I like what Kristen and Willow are wearing. And especially their styling, the juxtaposition of classic and funky. Chanel is already famous for their classic style, bringing young and modern styling is good move. Its fun and personal like it should be.

Kristen Stewart looks positively Uncle Fester-esque in that dress.
Willow and Jaden Smith on the other hand look both effortlessly elegant and original. They actually look better than almost anyone else at the gala. What a surprise.

Lily Rose looks like 16 going on 40. Her face looks really old and haggard here for some reason, which is weird because I saw a pic of her last week and she looked 12. shes still gorgeous, but this is a big no. I think the low cut on that dress is inappropriate too, but maybe Im just getting old.

Willow first, most definitely! Usually she bugs me to no end, but the girl looks sophisticated and stylish. Props to her!
Kristen in second, with a very far off third for the satan spawn Depp, who comes off as thirsty and up her own ass.

Shes really gunning for that Lolita look IMO.

The only nice thing I can say about Kristens Gramma dress is that it appears to come with some black licorice, in case she gets hungry.

Is Kristen Stewart expected to be at this thing every year? I know shes the face of a fashion house, but she generally acts as if its somewhat the worst thing in the world to act like youre interested in behaving
like a movie star or fashion plate that I dont get why shes at this thing year after year.
She has a nice smile
she should use it more often.

The Smiths look adorable. Even though Willows look is mature in the sense that its sophisticated, she is still somehow young looking and age appropriate and very pretty. Jaden looks cute as a button. They certainly are beautiful children or I suppose young adults.
Lily, Lily, I wish my mother could sit you down for a good talking to. Youd be standing up straight with that sulky look off of your face so fast your head would spin. Lol

I dont feel too comfortable smack-talking
a teenager, but Lily Rose gives me the creeps.
Either shes way too much into her fashion icon role, and wants to look smug all the time, or she has a sever case of the blues going on. Why should a 16-year old be so depressed? She looks bleak and aloof most of the time. Also, I am aware this is probably her body type, considering shes the spitting image of her mom, but her thinness is scary.

I think willow looks great.
Jadens expression ruins whatever look he was trying to pull. Lily Depp needs to stand up straighter and work on her facial expressions too because theyre worse than Jadens. Im so sick of the blank, mouth open look. You look like an idiot. Looking at you too, Lorde.

Definitely like Willows the best. Kristen just looks awful, period.
Anna W should just drop themes.
No one gets it right- esp this year- and go with come as you are.
