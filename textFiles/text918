Muslims hold the key for Mamatas return into powerThe community plays a decisive factor in about 125 seats, of which Congress won 95 in 2011Published: 16:21 May 3, 2016 Archisman Dinda, CorrespondentAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisKolkata: The Muslim community in West Bengal holds the key for the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) to return into power. And no one knows this better than Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been often criticised for appeasing the community on religious grounds.In the five years that she has been in power, Mamata has sought to consolidate the Muslim vote. There have been the controversial stipends to imams, the setting up of Haj houses, a new campus for Aliah University, sanction for 400 madrasa hostels and scholarships for Muslim students. She even did not allow controversial writers Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasreen to set foot in Kolkata, while welcoming Pakistan singer Ghulam Ali with open arms.In all her speeches, she never forgets to seek dua (blessings) from the community leaders and this time even got right wing Muslim outfits such as the Jammat-e Ulema-Hind (JuH) to an extent that the influential general secretary of the JuH, Saddiqullah Chowdhury, agreed to contest on a TMC ticket from Katua constituency in Burdwan district, although JuH has its own political outfit, the Peoples Democratic Conference of India (PUCI).On the other hand, Toha Siddiqui, the Peerzada of Furfura sharif shrine that holds equal clout on rural Bengali Muslims of south Bengal, is also by her side. To add to the numbers, the Shahi Imam of Tipu Sultan Mosque, Nurur Rehman Barkati, as an efficient party spokesperson defends the TMC in television interviews. Also Abdul Razzak Mollah, former veteran from the CPM fold, switched sides and is contesting from Bangur, his old constituency in South 24 Parganas.However, in spite of such backing from the Muslim community, there are grievances especially within the younger generation who are tired of being segregated based on religion. Appealing to us on grounds of secularism is fine. But what about jobs, questions Shiek Mumtir, an unemployed graduate in South 24 Parganas.Similar questions have been raised by many young voters as many families are divided on who to vote. My parents will vote for the TMC. But I will vote for the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], said Abdur Ansar, a 24-year-old from Birbhum district. The belief that Muslims vote en masse on religious grounds is wrong notion, he said.The Muslim community did vote for Mamata in both 2011 and 2014 in fear of the BJP. But this time with the CPM-Congress party alliance, things can become tricky for her [Mamata] as they also have secular credentials and are equal claimants to the communities vote, said election watcher Subir Deb Burman.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from India Man with golden shirt gets world record7 minutes agoIndia: Forest guards held over rhino poaching15 minutes agoMuslims hold key for Mamatas return into power17 minutes agoIndia has jurisdiction in Italian marine case18 minutes agoLong road ahead for Mamatas Trinamool Congress29 minutes agoRebels, namesakes spoil candidates chances32 minutes agoNirbhaya-like rape-murder of girl stuns Kerala03:04 pmForest fires can cause glacier melting, floods02:55 pm tags from this storyBharatiya Janata Partyfollow this tag on MGNPakistanfollow this tag on MGNMamata Banerjeefollow this tag on MGNIndiafollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsNewsAsiaIndiatagsBharatiya Janata Partyfollow this tag on MGN+MGNPakistanfollow this tag on MGN+MGNMamata Banerjeefollow this tag on MGN+MGNIndiafollow this tag on MGN+MGNAlso In IndiaEnclave dwellers to vote for first time since 					Framed Gallery Shiite pilgrims converge on Baghdad shrineUS cruise in decades docks in Havana
