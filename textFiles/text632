Going on from the thread about Rank Points got me thinking. The published figure for Chief Colonel is 0.1 % so 1 in 1 thousand ? So why in the companies ranks there are more than 2,000 in each company (on GB1) yet only 1 Chief Colonel per company ?

A few years ago there was a problem with people making bots which would just create a lot of accounts, one of the German servers has 120,000 members in one of their companies, which meant they had 12 basic generals x).
So DO changed the ranking system so that only accounts which are over lv2 count towards the ranking system so that most of the accounts which make up the company numbers are irrelevant.
Would be nice if each company could have a set up minimum number of each of the top ranks instead, so for instance there would always be a minimum of 3 Chief Colonels per company, no matter how dead the server way.
Bit silly that Chief Colonels are are rare as Generals in most servers.
