I thought this cartoon might be of interest!

Hmmmm
You are in Thailand now so just live like the Thais...do not think about the future...just think about today ...the moment.
Just joking...but seriously folks...I guess you have to pursue a hobby or maybe several hobbies.
Keep fit and exercise and at least once a week .....some sexercise....all part of good male health...lol
Maybe consider joining in with a charitable organization and give back a little...good for the soul you know.
Believe me if you search you will find something to do that occupies your time and keeps you busy...but not too busy that your exhausting yourself.
Cheers

I expect to die somewhere between 70 and 90.
Then it's " up the chimney" for me!
Not that easy mate you could contract Dementia or Parkinson what you are going to do then ?
Who is going to look after you if you can't even remember your own name ?
And who is going to pay for you certainly not a health insurance

Many seem to end up at the Nana Hotel sitting in their wheel chairs staring at all the ladies coming and going.
Still cheaper than a rest home in their home countries.
I wouldn't worry about it as it could all end quick with an accident or a natural,
medical incident.
