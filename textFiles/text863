Christine And The Queens Interviewed: 'Elton John Left Me A Phone Message - I Still Havent Called Back'
By Alex Flood
3rd May 2016
Home &sol; Blogs &sol; Blog Article
Hlose Letissier (aka Christine and the Queens) is a pansexual, alt-pop singer from France who last year got spanked by Madonna in front of 20,000 adoring fans. And if thats not unusual enough for you, shes probably the first person in history to have to leave Paris in order to find inspiration.
Paris is sometimes stiff and in London you have a great cultural mix, she says of her escape in 2010. I ended up at [scuzzy London club] Madame Jojos and met some drag queens. It couldnt have happened back home.
Out of the vibrant Soho queer scene came the Queens, and with shimmering electro-indie debut album Chaleur Humaine (translated as Human Warmth) now released to critical acclaim, Madge isnt the only one whos fallen for the rising star. Elton [John] left me a message, saying, Im at my house in Nice, Id love you to call me back, grins the Nantes-born 27-year-old. I still havent though
Im shy.
Hloses alter-ego Christine certainly isnt a shrinking violet though. Her magnetic stage presence and Michael Jacksonesque dance routines electrify audiences, while the emotional revelations on the record cant fail to move. Although more Lana Del Rey than the King of Pop overall, its easy to see where Hlose takes her cues from, even if she still cant moonwalk.
She is a worrier at heart, though, admitting shes afraid she might break the magic behind her music at some point, and also fretting about whether people will soon tire of her and start to swipe me right like on Tinder. Shes way too modest: with France already conquered and a sold out UK tour now in the bag too, theres little chance of things quietening down for Christine and the Queens anytime soon.CHRISTINE AND THE QUEENS: NEED TO KNOWBASED
