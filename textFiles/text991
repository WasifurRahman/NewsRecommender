The 7th edition of the Chromatic festival will unfold from May 19th to May 22nd at the Hangar 16 of Montreal's Old Port and at the eclectic Phi Centre. This year's edition will present an overview of Montreal and Toronto's artistic effervescence. This years edition will showcase an expanded format, a new venue and a program more immersive than ever: everything is set in place to launch the festival season in grand fashion. Families, night owls and professionals are all invited to join us and enjoy the most festive exhibition of the Printemps Numrique!Montral x Toronto exhibition at Hangar 16Counting more than 25 000 festivalgoers at the Mount Royal Chalet in 2015, the Chromatic festival pursues its expansion by setting home in another iconic location in the city: The Hangar 16 in the Old Port. With 14,000 square feet on the bank of the Saint Lawrence River, the location is more than fit to welcome a multidisciplinary exhibit merging two of the most creative Canadian cities talents. The result will be mesmerizing: a cutting-edge exhibition bringing together paintings, photographic, new media and digital artworks of more than 50 artists.The festivals solid lineup includes artists from Toronto such as Bambii (DJ), Camille Jodoin-Eng and Elise Victoria Louise Windsor (installation artists), as well as Lauren Pelc-McArthur (painter and video artist). Montreals creativity will be represented by Julie Roch-Cuerrier, Caroline Monnet, Elie Zananiri, and many others. Renowned international artists such as Guillaume Marmin and Mike Pelletier will also be showcased during Chromatic. Guided tours of the exhibition will be offered from 11AM to 6PM, on May 21 and 22 at the Hangar 16, which will also welcome the Chromatic Nights and Chromatic Junior.Four New FeaturesThree Chromatic Nights instead of oneThe memorable Chromatic Night sees triple this year. Chromatic will greet three times more bands and DJs than last year that will take over the Hangar 16 stage to make partygoers dance on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings. It's the ultimate festive night mixing virtual reality, interactive creations, visual immersion and wild musical performances
With quality musical partners such as Heavy Trip, Moto Made and Moonshine, each Chromatic Night will have a different flavor. By going from 4 to 13 musical artists, we dramatically multiplied the opportunities to party!
