LJUBLJANA (Slovenia), May 3 (SeeNews) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it has slightly lowered its forecast for Slovenia's economic growth this year to 1.7% due to lower public spendingafter two years of exceptionally high investment at the end of the drawdown period of EU funding.In February, the EU projected that Slovenia's economy will expand by 1.8% in 2016. In 2015 the country's GDP growth eased slightly to 2.9% from a revised 3.0% a year earlier.In its Spring Forecast report the Commission said that private consumption, boosted by increasing employment, rising wages and a mild housing market recovery, is forecast to remain the main driver of growth in both 2016 and 2017, with GDP growth seen to accelerate to 2.3% next year.Exports too are expected to continue to contribute substantially to growth over the coming period, but with a decreasing net effect over the forecast horizon, as rising private consumption fuels imports, the EU explained.Falling energy prices which pushed inflation into negative territory in 2015 (-0.8%) are forecast to keep the annual rate of inflation negative this year at -0.2%, the Commission noted. However, prices are expected to start rising again in the fourth quarter of 2016 and inflation should accelerate to 1.6% in 2017 as oil prices recover and wages increase.In 2015, the general government deficit fell considerably - to 2.9% of GDP from 5% in 2014. It is expected to fall further to 2.4% of GDP in 2016 and 2.1% next yearmainly due to buoyant tax receipts under a no-policy-change assumption.Overall risks to public finances over the forecast horizon are tilted to the downside as uncertainty remains regarding the expenditure linked to migration, the Commission explained.Furthermore, the ongoing work out of nonperforming loans poses risks to the government deficit through the activities of the BAMC and the possibility of an adverse impact from the resolution in the first quarter of 2016 of two financial institutions currently in wind down.Slovenia's debt-to-GDP ratio continued to increase in 2015 and is expected to have peaked at 83.2%. It is expected to fall to 80.2% and 78.0% of GDP in 2016 and 2017, respectively, helped by the economic recovery and a reduction in precautionary cash buffers.
