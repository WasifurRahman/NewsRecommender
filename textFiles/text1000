Diana Garnet to Perform at Otakon Matsuri 2016
May 3rd 2016
Baltimore, MD (May 2, 2016)
Diana Garnet, one of the few prominent foreign artists signed to
a major Japanese record label, will perform at the 2016 Otakon Matsuri, Otakorp Inc. is pleased
to announce.
Born in Washington D.C., U.S.A., Garnet was heavily influenced by her anime-loving father, and was
immersed into anime culture at a young age. Hearing "Yuzurenai Negai" by Naomi Tamura inspired
her lifetime goal to become a singer in Japan.
On her third trip to Japan, she began to work as a middle-school English teacher, when a life-changing
opportunity arose. In 2013, she took part in a nationwide karaoke TV show for foreigners, called
"Nodojiman! THE WORLD 2013 Spring" on NTV and was crowned the winner, also securing a major
label debut at the same time.
After releasing cover works for her first single and mini-album, Garnet's first original single, "Spinning
World," was chosen as the ending theme song for the mega-hit anime, "Naruto: Shippuden," making
her the first female solo foreign artist to sing an anime theme song.
Since then, she has also featured in FLOW's best album as a guest vocalist, and was also tapped as
one of the likely breakout stars of 2015 in Yahoo! Japan's Video Topic Awards.
Her second original single, "Nankai! Mystery," was chosen as the theme song for the NHK E-TV
anime "Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note," which will air from October 2015 to March 2016, further elevating
her status among anime and mass audiences alike.
The Otakon Matsuri is an outdoor street festival that will be held from 12:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.
on Thursday, August 11 at Baltimore's beautiful West Shore Park at the Inner Harbor. Admission
is free to both the Otakorp membership as well as to the general public. The event features many
attractions to keep attendees well-occupied: games, contests, prizes, live entertainment, great
food, and even Otakon guests, who have been known to stop by and take part in the festivities.
Otakon 2016 will be held August 12-14 at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, MD.
ABOUT OTAKON AND OTAKORP, INC.: Now entering its twenty-third year, Otakon is an annual
celebration of Japanese and East Asian popular culture, and also one of the largest gatherings of
fans in the United States. Otakon celebrates popular culture as a gateway to deeper
understanding of Asian culture, and has grown along with the enthusiasm for anime, manga,
video games, and music from the Far East. Since 1999, Otakon has been held in Baltimore,
Maryland; currently, Otakon is one of Baltimore's few large, city-wide events, drawing over 34,000
people for three days each year (for a paid attendance of over 100,000 turnstile attendees).
Otakon is a membership based convention sponsored by Otakorp, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based,
501(c)3 educational non-profit whose mission is to promote the appreciation of Asian culture,
primarily through its media and entertainment. Otakorp, Inc. is directed by an all-volunteer, unpaid
staff
we are run by fans, for fans.

Answerman - Why Do Manga Artists Prefer To Stay Anonymous?

manga
Famous mangaka for series like Death Note can be famously withdrawn from the public eye, rarely granting interviews or even pictures. What's with that?
Federico asks: Why in recent years are manga artists so obsessed with privacy, to the point we know next to nothing about them? Decades ago they had no problem in being interviewed, filmed, photographed, and mostly anyone who was interested in thei...

Eden of the East made a huge splash back in 2009, but how well has its techno-thriller storyline aged? James checks out Funimation's fancy new special edition. PLUS: this week's new releases!
As amusing as I find Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto, I'm increasingly convinced that I'm primarily watching it as an excuse to enjoy its opening theme once a week. It's cool, cooler, coolest. Before we dive ...

Mike tries out the flashy shonen cooking action of Food Wars, but an enticing aroma leads him further to Oishinbo, the series that really catapulted food manga into popular consciousness. Let's eat!
I've spent the last couple of weeks commuting back and forth to the library, in pursuit of a particular manga series. You may remember, from my Monster Girl Hoedown column, that I'm quite fond of levera...

The Gods Lie is a bittersweet coming-of-age story about two children finding solace in each other told in a quiet, understated style that tugs gently at your heartstrings without going overboard.
There are many different kinds of lies: small ones, harmful ones, and, most insidious, the ones you desperately want to believe. There comes a point during growing up when you begin to understand that last...

They said it couldn't be done, but when asked to compile a list of monkeys in anime, you simply can't have less than twelve, including Dragon Ball Z, Blood Blockade Battlefront and much more!
Our regular list-maker extraordinaire, Lynzee Loveridge, is going on hiatus for a couple weeks, so I'll be filling in while she's away. My name's Jacob Chapman, and this week, I've got monkeys on my mind. Why...

The second volume of Arina Tanemura's magical woman story brings us into the past and mind of the series' de-facto mascot character, Tokita, as she continues to play with the magical girl genre.
Why is Tokita helping Chikage to relive her adolescence? Volume one of Arina Tanemura's magical woman story implies that it's just because she was his first love back in the 9th grade, but is that really en...

What is it that makes the superheroes in Japan's megasize hits One-Punch Man and My Hero Academia feel so different from our old friends Iron Man and Batman? The differences are wider than you might think.
Superheroes are extremely popular right now. Regardless of how you feel about the trend of a new comic-based movie or television series premiering every five minutes, it's undeniable that cape-we...

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is just as insane as ever with its overpowered fights and insane anatomy. This volume adds some emotional heft to the story as well, forcing Jojo himself to do some growing up.
Are you excited for more Jojo after the cliffhanger of volume two?! Hirohiko Araki sure is! He wants you to know that every sentence is important, too, or that nearly every word spoken in Battle Tend...
