Woman lands in court after complaint of stalkerDivorcee cleared of having consensual sex with man who claimed to be her husbandPublished: 17:36 May 2, 2016 Bassam Za'za', Legal and Court CorrespondentAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisDubai: A divorced mother, who walked into a police station to complain that another man had been stalking her, landed in court after prosecutors charged them both with having consensual sex.The Emirati woman headed to the police station in November to complain about an Algerian man stalking and harassing her over the phone, according to records.Police interrogators summoned the Algerian man and, upon confronting him with the womans complaint, he countered her claims, alleging that she was his wife and he had had consensual sex with her in Algeria and in his flat in December 2 Street.Prosecutors then charged the couple with having consensual sex and referred them to the Dubai Misdemeanours Court.The woman strongly refuted what she described as the mans unfounded lies and pleaded innocent. She contended that she had been married to an Emirati man, from whom she had three children.Meanwhile the Algerian suspect claimed to the Misdemeanours Court that the woman was his wife and they had had consensual and lawful sex in Algeria and Dubai. Howeverm he failed to provide the court with any written proof that they were married.The Emirati womans advocate, Hamda Makki, contended before the Misdemeanours Court that her client was a victim of a fabricated, unfounded and groundless case.My client is a victim of the mans lies and unsubstantiated allegations. He claimed that she was his wife but the forensic reports came to refute his claims. Prosecutors failed to corroborate their accusation and had only relied on the mans claims. Actually my clients main complaint [stalking complaint] was discarded and neglected
law enforcement officers should have looked into her complaint and treated it more seriously, contended lawyer Makki.The Algerian man had falsely alleged to the police that he had impregnated the Emirati woman and that she wanted to get rid of his baby, argued the lawyer.All his claims to the police were lies and untrue. My client had never slept with him. He had tried to communicate with her in Algeria but she rejected him. When my client was referred to the forensic laboratory for examination, it was proved that she had not had any recent sexual intercourse and had never had an abortion. The mans claims were all deceptive and slurs
my client is innocent and she had not had committed any wrongdoing. The Algerian man is the real criminal who should be tried for falsely and maliciously reporting to the police that he had consensual sex with my client, contended Makki.The Dubai Misdemeanours Court acquitted the couple of having consensual sex for lack of evidence.The Dubai Appeal Court also upheld the duos acquittal that remains subject to appeal before the Cassation Court within a week.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from Courts Jailed American mother fights for girls custody03:15 pmWoman lands in court after complaint of stalkerWaiter lands in court over 500gm of drugMaid accused of stealing sponsors passportClerk gave man fatal push after birthday partyDrunk man threatens to burn accommodationWoman in court for attacking man with wine glassInvestor jailed for causing Dh8.4m loss tags from this storyDubaifollow this tag on MGNAlgeriafollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsNewsUAECourtstagsDubaifollow this tag on MGN+MGNAlgeriafollow this tag on MGN+MGNAlso In CourtsJailed American mother fights for girls custody 					News Gallery Shiite pilgrims converge on Baghdad shrineUS cruise in decades docks in Havana
