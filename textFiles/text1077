Albion will go into promotion-decider at Boro with no fear

Have your say
Albion boss Chris Hughton says his side will go to Middlesbrough with no fear on Saturday.
The Seagulls need to win the game to clinch promotion into the Premier League after a 1-1 draw at home to Derby this afternoon left them behind the Teesiders on goal difference.Hughton said: Not many people have beaten Middlesbrough when theyve been at home but its about playing well enough.
Weve been good away from home for a large majority of the season. If I look at the teams right up there, the Derbys and Burnleys, we havent lost to them away. We need to now go one step further and win a game.
Sometimes when you go into a game knowing a draw will do, you can have a draw mentality and that can lead to a losing mentality. We know what we have to do, we just need to show enough quality to do it.Were up against a very good team, who are at home, so theres no doubt theyre favourites and they would be pleased with the result today but well give ourselves every chance.Weve been good away from home, well make sure not to go there with any fear and give ourselves the best chance.Hughton praised his sides finish in the closing stages today as James Wilson equalised deep in injury-time. He said: The end of the game showed a real desire to get back into the game and if we get that goal two minutes earlier, you never know with the momentum.
It will give us something, theres no doubt. To lose or draw the game doesnt change too much with what the task is on Saturday.Weve been up against a very good side today, we probably werent at our best but its still a game we didnt lose.Lewis Dunks red card for two bookings means he will miss the promotion-decider with Middlesbrough and Hughton said: Its a big blow because hes had continuity. Since a difficult period he had a while ago, hes been outstanding. He will be a loss but weve had that at other times this season and weve got Gordon Greer, our captain.Dont miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live.
