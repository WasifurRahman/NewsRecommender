Warminster School gearing up for Narnia performance
9:46am Tuesday 3rd May 2016 in
By Robin Murray, Reporter
WARMINSTER School is gearing up for a new performance to be staged at the school next month.
The drama department has been given Rupert Goold's new stage adaptation of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, CS Lewis's tale of four children who discover the enchanted land of Narnia on the other side of an old wardrobe.
School grounds will be transformed into Narnia and the performance will take place in a big top tent, with a vast sculpture of Aslan and a cast of over 40 pupils, it will be a real experience for the audience.
Head of Drama Emily Harris said: "This is an exciting production, with the magic of Narnia and the opportunity to perform in a completely different way.
Rehearsals are going well and our actors have been challenged to think about performing in the round. This adaptation creates a sense of pace and Lewis' story is both raw and accessible.
Puppetry and live performance specialists Pickled Image were selected to help with the job of bringing the regal Aslan to life.
Since its inception, Pickled Image has gained international recognition and numerous awards for their darkly humorous visual productions.
Dik Downey, Company Director at Pickled Image and a highly experienced talented designer and puppet maker, visited Warminster School to workshop the magnificent looking Aslan.
Tickets are available for June 9 and 10, contact Hannah Vickers to book on hvickers@warminsterschool.org.uk
