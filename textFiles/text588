Cat-Cow: ?It connects us with the breath,? says Meg Allen, yoga instructor and owner of Jai Albany. ?When you connect the movement with the breath, it brings in the meditative qualities of the practice.
Move forward to the edge of your chair. Your legs should be bent with your ankles directly under your knees. Place your hands on your knees. (Cindy Schultz / Times Union) less

For the Cat: Exhale slowly through your nose as you round your spine and bring your chin to your chest. Draw your navel back toward your spine. The Cat is not finished until you?ve completed the exhale. Repeat five times. (Cindy Schultz / Times Union) less

Standing Crescent: ?Opening up the side of the body makes space to deepen the breath which is great for calming the central nervous system and reducing stress,? Allen says. ?When you deepen the breath, you learn to focus and calm your mind, which improves function at work and home.? Stand behind your chair (no rolling chairs, please) with your right hand on the chair?s back and your feet a hip?s width apart.
Raise your left arm and shift your hips to the left as your reach sideways to your right side. Take five deep breaths as you move deeper into the pose, leaning farther to the right. Be sure to continuously elongate the spine and feel the lift up as you lean over.
Place your left hand on your chair and repeat movement, bringing the right arm up and bending over to your left side as you take five deep breaths. Perform once on each side. (Cindy Schultz / Times Union) less

Neck and Shoulder Release: ?If you?re hunching and rounding all day, as most of us are, this helps open us up where we really close down,? Allen says. While standing with your feet about hip?s width apart, interlace your fingers behind your back. Find grounding beneath your feet. (Cindy Schultz/Times Union) less

Your elbows can stay slightly bent here, but if you?re able, you can begin to straighten your arms and bring your palms together.
Lift your chin gently and begin to lift your heart toward the sky, remembering to keep your spine long as you open up your chest. Your hips can slowly reach forward, but stay grounded in your foundation beneath your feet. Hold for 10 breaths. Perform once. (Cindy Schultz / Times Union) less

Happy Hips: ?It?s good for relieving the hip rotators and tight hips and buttocks,? Allen says. ?Just the act of sitting all day can really tighten your lower body.? Position yourself at the edge of your chair. Your feet should be a hip?s width apart, ankles under your knees.
Grounding your weight in your left foot, grab your right ankle and sit it on your left thigh. Be sure to sit up tall, with a straight spine. Hold for 10 deep breaths. Repeat movement with the left ankle over the right thigh. Do it once on each side. (Cindy Schultz / Times Union) less

1/11
Back to Gallery
If you feel like your spine has been permanently molded into the shape of your office chair and your shoulders are forever rounded over a keyboard even when there's not a laptop within 100 yards, you need this.Do your body a favor and find a way to stretch at work. Meg Allen, owner of Jai Albany, a yoga studio tucked along Madison Avenue, says yoga is a way of "finding poses that counter the poses of life." Or in your case, the shape of your body creating spreadsheets and answering email. So if your shoulders curve, she wants you to learn to open up the chest. If your spine is packed down into your chair, she wants it long and tall as you stand by your desk.
Click through the slides for details on these yoga-inspired stretches and don't worry about what your co-workers think. It would be good for their shoulders
and their prana
too.
