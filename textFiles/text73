Big movie news that me and my canine gal Shang are excited to share;) To produce, create and deliver original properties to fans like HBO's #ballers to this summer's #CentralIntelligence is one of the best parts of my job.
But to take great properties that are beloved worldwide like #BAYWATCH and #RAMPAGE and have the opportunity reimagine their stories in dope new ways to a whole new generation is truly an honor. It's official. We'll produce and deliver to a whole new generation a title that I love and is one of my all time favs:

#JUMANJI #JungleLife #JustPressStart #SONYPicturesA photo posted by therock (@therock) on Apr 22, 2016 at 8:36am PDTThe original film was about siblings Peter and Judy Shepherd, who decide to play a magical board game that unleashes a world of adventure, danger and magic -- so that they can save a man who has been trapped by the game for decades. The film starred Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst as the siblings and the late Robin Williams as Alan Parrish, whose childhood was stolen by the jungle-themed game.Last year, Sony Pictures announced that they would be making a "Jumanji" reboot. The "Jumanji" reboot kicked off last year after Sony Pictures announced the titles of several upcoming movies. The family friendly movie is set to swing into theaters July 28, 2017.But this isn't the only reboot that the 43-year-old actor has hitched his wagon to. The former wrestler is currently shooting the "Baywatch" movie, which stars Pamela Anderson, Zac Efron, and Priyanka Chopra, and he is also is adapting the video game, "Rampage," into a feature-length film.Who needs new ideas when you can just pillage old ones?!
