That's why we have NATO

To protect us from each other?
Which side would the Americans be on and when?
I don't think the UK has much to worry about in this department.
The US will back the UK.
There is that little grouping called the Commonwealth and if the US decided not to side with the UK, there is that big country to the North that would not be happy and there is that one down under that would less cordial as well.
There's also some islands in the Caribbean sea that might object as well.
It would not be in the US's interest to abandon the UK.

Maybe this is the time, maybe to chip in with one more useful bit of information for the Brexiters.
I live in Luxembourg, when I'm not in Thailand, and those of you who think that EU migration to the UK has already got out of hand might wish to consider the following figures: slightly over 40% of the residents of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are immigrants (like me). Over 50% of the residents of the capital city, Luxembourg City, are immigrants (like me) and do you know what, we all bump along just famously! Oh and perhaps I should also mention that this is not a recent phenomenon, it's been like this for years. Has it impacted the country's economy? I'd say so! Luxembourg is the richest country in the EU and, by at least one international benchmark (GDP per capita), the richest in the world. So yes it has impacted the economy, it's made the country rich!
Would I be correct in thinking that you are one of the Auditors for the EU. Thus enabling you to spend most of the year here in Thailand.

Sent from my SMART_4G_Speedy_5inch using TapatalkThose figures don't even begin to tell the truth. The amount given for Spain refers to Brits registered on the consulate. The real figure is closer to 800K. I'm on the mobile and can't be bothered to search for the many articles you will find just by Google it. If you can't find them let me know and when I get back I will post the relevant linkd
I don't understand,it has already been pointed out to you,more than once, the actually cost to the UK tax payer of treating EU national. Yet you still repeat inaccuracies. Continuing to say the UK should leave this corrupt so called Union while at the same time trying to make points to why we should remain in.
Are you a Troll?
What you don't understand is that the load on the infrastructure is much more than the direct cost of a medical service for example

I'm not repeating inaccuracies. I'm stating facts. There are over 800,000 Brits living in Spain of which a vast majority are retired therefore not paying any taxes in Spain but using infrastructures such as roads, beaches etc and we would prefer if you were not in the EU so that we could start implementing measures to make sure that only quality Brits are able to live in Spain. As I said earlier I would have a 40K permanent seasoning in a bank account and compulsory health insurance for all foreigners not only brits that did not pay any taxes in Spain. The foreigners with small pensions who just scrape by and cant take care of medical bills should not be allowed to stay. I focus on Brits because as its by far the largest nation to live in Spain and by being in the EU its makes it too easy for cheap charlies to live there. These measures are not too far away from what we have to go through in Thailand and similar to the requirements Brits will be asking of foreigners. Is that unreasonable?

When the UK leaves the EU, other countries will follow and the EU house of cards will collapse.
So you can argue that if the UK leaves the EU, the UK could not trade with the EU, but if we leave and the EU collapses, we would all be Independent countries again, free to trade with each other, Including Germany and France.
Yeah! We can have some wars again!
Achtung! Spitfire
Argh! Gott in Himmel
Can't wait!!
Fools.......
NATO has kept the peace all through the Cold War years and is still important today. Nobody is talking about turning our backs on our European friends, only leaving the corrupt EU which has turned into an undemocratic monster.
It has transformed from a trade and industry partnership into a a controlling political entity, now talking about having its own army!
Now why would they want control of their own army when we have NATO?
You are far more likely to get your war if we remain in.
