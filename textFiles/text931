Drivers face court over speeding on link road
Updated 5:11pm Monday 2nd May 2016 in
By Bruno Clements
POLICE stopped three vehicles for speeding on the new temporary link road at Royal Wootton Bassett - one doing twice the 30mph limit.
A spokesman for the local team posted on their Facebook page: "In a short time three vehicles were stopped, one ticket was issued and two drivers were reported for speeding.
"Due to their high speeds tickets were not considered suitable.
"One driver was seen doing 60mph, double the speed limit! The road is clearly signed and these speeds will not be tolerated."
The link road was built to save a diversion of more than 37 miles while Network Rail carries out electrification work.
