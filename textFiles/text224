Pat Nevin: History game
Pat Nevin: History game
column
Tue 3 May 2016
With the dust still settling, Pat Nevin reflects on an extraordinary night at the Bridge and an equally remarkable new league winner
Down the years there have been some epic games between Chelsea and Spurs. Lately the Lilywhites have struggled to get past the Blues, but many from North London will mention the 5-3 league game last season. It was a rare ray of light for them, but in terms of the most important recent games our 2015 League Cup final win over them tops the 5-3. Even that will probably elicit a question about the 1967 FA Cup final, but realistically it is all scraping and scratching at the surface because, in global terms, the 2-2 draw at the Bridge last night may well go down as the most significant result between the two.
The ramifications were of course that Leicester City won the Premier League and Tottenham could no longer. There have been few more dramatic nights in sport and Stamford Bridge was certainly at the centre of the planet for those mad 90 minutes.
Everything was set, starting with the build-up to the game. Some of our players and most of our fans made it clear they wanted to win for Leicester as well as themselves. The derby atmosphere was cranked up. The evening kick-off added more. The league rested on the game, as did the fairy tale of Leicester.
"In the middle of it all, Chelsea once again gave a performance with echoes of the team we watched last season."
-
The Premier League title should be won honestly and that is vitally important; a Chelsea team with the proverbial beach towels out would have been rightly pilloried. I am not sure if there are that many leagues around the world where a team with nothing to play for - other than pride - would put in that level of effort, particularly when they were 2-0 down.
Added to that was the level of fouling meted out by our visitors. In a normal Premier League game there is a possibility that two or three of them would have been sent off. Even the most anti-Chelsea observers were clear that our lads were kicked up and down the park for most of the night.
There was however one individual in the press, a former referee, who couldnt resist a suggestion that Diego Costa must have been to blame for the treatment he received because our striker probably said something. Even in the face of the most damning evidence to the contrary some cant see what is directly in front of them without showing bias.
But that is secondary. What we witnessed at the Bridge was high drama, extraordinary tension and, most importantly, football history. So while we enjoyed the fallout following the extraordinary equaliser by Eden Hazard, the story was of course all about Leicester City, their players and their manager. In situations like these there is a media overload, consisting of constant interviews with anyone and everyone who had or has anything to do with Leicester, be it the team or the place. As it goes on and on, after a few weeks or months, it might start to grate just a little.
The thing that will stop this getting on your nerves though is of course Claudio Ranieri and his endless charm. So make your documentaries and even the Hollywood movie if you like as long as you get someone fabulously good and stunningly nice to play Claudio. It has been a joy to watch him and listen to him this season. For all the fun and the silliness I have been most impressed by his psychology and his rather overlooked tactical acumen. Doubtless the movie and the upcoming documentaries will delve deep into that stuff actually maybe not.
Claudios class shone through at every turn and among his first thoughts when Chelsea won the league for him was to call Guus Hiddink to thank him personally. So it will be a little while before I get bored with the plucky, 5000-1, underdog narrative. Both they and he absolutely deserve it.
In the middle of it all, Chelsea once again gave a performance with echoes of the team we watched last season. Eden of course was the catalyst when he came on and although he was thumped all over the place - just as Cesc, Willian, Pedro and Diego were too - he once again threw in some moments of his true genius for us to enjoy. The pleasure and the pain of watching him give that little cameo and knowing what we had missed all season was at the back of every Chelsea mind. Can we hope to see an entire season of his greatness again at the Bridge? I hope so.
It was quite shocking to see those blatant lunges, and thats before we even get to the deliberate stamping and gouging, but then I realised that to some eyes it was just a bit old school. It is true it wasnt uncommon when I played. However, I am delighted we are so shocked by it now. Unacceptance of this type of tackling clearly gives more opportunities for skilful players to entertain us with their ability. That is why we can hopefully enjoy Eden Hazard at his best and indeed Riyad Mahrez for longer than we would have in years gone by.
So as the historic evening fades away (though it never will in Leicester) we look forward to the weekend. For all the articles and news stories today, Sunderland will think that last night was little more than a warm-up for the far more important game at the weekend. Expect plenty of tension for that one as well.
Last week in the quiz I asked what you thought the score would be in the game last night. There was a huge number of you guessing and it has to be said the most popular prediction was 2-1 to Chelsea. However, the second most popular was actually 2-2! The winner from the correct answers drawn at random is Peter Stanton.
This week to have a chance of winning a copy of the new Official Programme Book signed by one of the players, could you tell me the answer to this one?
Last night, Eden Hazard scored the decisive goal which decided the destination of the title. He did likewise last season, too. But before the Belgians winner against Crystal Palace a year ago today, who was the last player to score a decisive, winning goal at Stamford Bridge that detemined the destination of Englands top-flight championship?
Answers as ever in the box below and good luck with that.
