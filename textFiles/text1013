BUHL, Minn. - St. Louis County social service officials say they've reopened an investigation into a child sexual abuse allegation at a juvenile correctional facility on the Iron Range.
The Minnesota Department of Corrections also says it will meet with administrators at the facility, KidsPeace Mesabi Academy in Buhl, and county officials to discuss the state law that requires abuse allegations be reported to authorities.
The renewed investigation comes after APM Reports published a story about allegations involving staff, including a teenage boy who said he was sexually involved with a female staffer at Mesabi.
The allegation was part of a broader investigation conducted by the county into 20 abuse claims, which it said it could not substantiate. But the county also found maltreatment allegations were not immediately reported to authorities, which could be a violation of state law.
