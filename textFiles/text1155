WASHINGTON-- D.C. police released surveillance video Monday showing a person wanted in connection with an alleged attack on a Muslim woman outside of a Starbucks.Thewoman said a woman with blonde hairdumped an unknown substance on her outside of a Northwest D.C. Starbucks because she isMuslim, according to a police report.The woman was using free Wi-Fi at a Starbucks around10:30 p.m. on April 21, when the suspect began yelling faith-based insults at her, according to the report. She said the womantold her she was a"worthless piece of trash and a Muslim," and "we don't want you here in this country."She tried to ignore the insults, but the report said the suspect continued saying them. Cell phone video captured some of the verbal attack.I just got nervous, and I also got tired of it, she said. So I called 911.The victim, who does not want to be identified, said one officer responded. She said he approached the suspect and then her.And he said, I cant do anything about words. As soon as I put my police officer uniform on, Im called all kinds of names too. So its free speech, she explained.She said when the officer left so did the suspect, but only momentarily.According to the victim, the suspect snuck up on her and poured an unknown liquid-like substance on her head. He then fled down Connecticut Avenue.The woman's clothing was still moist when officers responded to the incident, according to the police report.It didnt burn my skin or anything, but it had a strange smell to it, she said.She lives a block away from the coffee shop.
I am still more nervous now since that happened when Im coming through at night time, she said.She said police told her that they have surveillance video of the incident. She filed a report and meets with officers Tuesday.Starbucks was closed when this happened, and the victim said she doesnt think there were any witnesses.She said she might not press charges if the suspect is mentally ill or apologetic for what they allegedly did.
