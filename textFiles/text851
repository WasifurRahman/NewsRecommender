Mac DeMarco announces two post-Glastonbury UK dates
Mac DeMarco has been pictured working in the studio with MGMT, leading to speculation that the two acts are recording music together.
MGMT released their self-titled third album in September 2013 and tweeted last year that they would return in 2016. DeMarco's last album, meanwhile, 'Salad Days' came Number Two in NMEs Albums Of 2014 list.
Now a photo has surfaced showing DeMarco playing guitar with MGMT frontman Andrew VanWyngarden. Stereogum notes how the home studio set-up is similar to that previewed in a video MGMT posted to Facebook in April.
See the picture and watch the aforementioned video below.

Somerset, Glastonbury Festival (June 22-26)
London, Electric Brixton (June 27)
London, Koko (June 28)
