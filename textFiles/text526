PROTESTERS FOR TRUMP:
I think its going to get worse if he gets the nomination and is the fro
May 3, 2016
YEAH, I PRETTY MUCH START WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE THINGS ARE FAKES NOW:
There Have Been Over 100 Hate Crime Hoaxes In The Past Decade.
Victimhood isnt just used to push agendas and win power. It can also be used to make money. Professional victims like feminist pest Anita Sarkeesian have received thousands of dollars in donations after complaints about unkind words on the internet.
Little wonder that theres been such an epidemic of hate crime hoaxes in the past few years, particularly among regressive activists on university campuses. Weve seen students scrawl swastikas on the doors of their own dorm rooms, send themselves anonymous rape threats, and falsely accuse fraternities of queer-bashing.

p dawg
All the hoaxers have done is make me assume anything reported as a "hate crime" is a hoax. They should have read "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" when they were young.

When victimhood comes with perceived virtue, those without virtue will fake victimhood to obtain it.
