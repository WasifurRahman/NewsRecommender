Have your say
Tickets for the home tie of Pompeys play-off semi-final against Plymouth with this week go on sale.
However, the Blues have still to learn the exact dates for the two-legged contest.Paul Cooks men will definitely face the Pilgrims, with next weekends final round of league fixtures to decide who has the perceived advantage of being at home for the second leg.
If Pompey finish in fifth position, Fratton Park will stage the second leg, to be played either on Sunday, May 15 (6pm) or Wednesday, May 18 (7.45pm).
Should they claim sixth spot, they will be at home in the first leg, to take place on either Thursday, May 12 (7.45pm) or Saturday, May 14 (7.30pm).Matters may be up in the air as regards dates for the Fratton faithfuls diaries but tickets are to go on sale at 10am on Wednesday, May 4.Season-ticket holders and Trust shareholders will then have until 8pm on Sunday, May 8, to purchase their seats.With interest among supporters anticipated to be high, Pompey have employed Quaytickets to provide a dedicated call centre to deal with demand.
The Quaytickets call centre will be manned by 40 staff seven-days-a-week, open from 9am to 8pm after Wednesdays opening day.Those wishing to order by phone can call 0333 320 0750.In addition, there is the option to buy through fans existing online accounts until May 8.Those season-ticket holders and shareholders wishing to secure their seats in person can visit the Frogmore Road ticket office or the Fratton end booths from 10am to 5pm from Wednesday to Friday.
Seats are restricted to one per season ticket holder/shareholder. General sale of tickets will begin on Monday, May 9, from 10am.Similarly, these can bought online by calling Quaytickets or by visiting the Frogmore Road ticket office.Tickets are priced at the usual match-day rate of 20 for adults, 15 for seniors (aged 61 plus), young persons (17-22) and 10 for wheelchair spaces and unaccompanied juniors (under-17s).When brought in the same transaction as a full-paying adult or senior, tickets are priced at 5 for juniors.
Seats bought over the phone from Quaytickets are subject to a 2.50 booking fee per ticket (which includes postage). Tickets purchased online will incur a 2 fee per transaction if they are posted
or a 1 fee per transaction if collected at Fratton Park.However, there is no additional charge for tickets printed at home by supporters.
