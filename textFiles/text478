Grim Dawn Receives Modding Tools
05.03.2016
ALEX FULLERNEWS DIRECTOR
Crate Entertainment's action RPG Grim Dawn has been out for a little over two months and its players are now able to create their own content for the game following the official release of modding tools. The modding tools are included for free as part of the game's v1.0.0.3 update and are the same as used as the development team when creating the game.
Grim Dawn is a third-person, loot-based action RPG in the vein of Diablo and similar titles. The game is set in an apocalyptic fantasy world and gives players five classes to choose from, each with its own skill tree, and the option to cross two classes together. The game features quests with branching results that are said to have consequences later in the game, plus a faction system, the ability to rebuild towns and rescue NPCs, and multiplayer for up to four players.
