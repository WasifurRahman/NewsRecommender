An excellent turnout of 63 Bognor Golf Club seniors took part in the seniors spring cup.
Its one of the seniors majors and the majority of the scores reflected the blustery conditions, though there were some superb scores registered by the winners.
This years format changed to include a drawn team-of-three format, with all scores counting.
After the competition all players were treated to bangers and mash. Seniors captain Jim Catt presented the prizes.
Results: Winner - Gary Steventon 42pts, 2 Phil Lee 40, 3 Jim Stephenson 39. Team winners
Gary Steventon, Stuart English & Andy Isitt, 2 Jim Stephensom, Roger Selway & Mike White, 3 Trevor Till, David Turner & Ivon Towse.Bognor seniors made the short journey to Selsey and a very close encounter could have swung either way. Bognor just lost out 4-2.Selsey, as usual, were excellent hosts and both teams look forward to the return in August.Results: Barry Ingate & KenCatt halved, Frank Hodder & Mike Wilson won 2&1, Bryan Madgwick & Peter Collins lost 6&5, RobbWalker & Peter McCormack lost 2 down, Andy Isitt & Terry Kuhler lost 3&2,
Ian Bright & Bob Lee halved.
COWDRAY PARKCowdray seniors travelled to Puttenham to face the home side, who are virtually unbeatable on their own patch as proved by their record in the Winter League. The visitors duly lost 4-1. Cowdray match manager Bill Brownlee and David Wickham were shown little mercy by their hosts, being beaten 7&6.John Newman and Peter Hallt briefly restored equilibrium with Cowdrays only win, by one up, followed by a half from Ken Marjoram and Chris Hoare before the home side completed their victory with wins in the final three matches.

Hawksley beat Barry Overington & Bill Birnie 1

They were led by former Cowdray Park Club captain Alan Austin, who always flourishes upon his return, this time being no exception.
He and partner Terry Roach racked up eight pars between them and put the home sides Gary Strowbridge and Robin Phillips to the sword, winning 4&2. Mike Cardiff and Wally Mitchell equalised with a 2&1 win, Bill Birnie and Philip Singer halved their match and David Wickham and Bill Brownlee won 3&2, with the remaining matches going to the visitors, albeit by narrow margins, and they claimed victory by 5-2.Results (Cowdray names first): Gary Strowbridge & Robin Philips lost to Alan Austin & Terry Roach 4&2; Mike Cardiff & Wally Mitchell beat Tim Allen & David Dunglinson 2&1; Peter Laws & Alastair Proctor lost to Bob Mitchell & John ORourke 1dn; Bill Birnie & Philip Singer halved with Marshall Smith & Jim Lutener; Chris Hutchings & Colin Tebbutt lost to John Spiers & Baron Howell 2&1; David Wickham & Bill Brownlee beat Paul Duncan & Richard Vardy 3&2; Howard Morley & Bruce Spooner lost to Derek Harrison & Ray Couzens 2 dn; Dave Coombes & George Crouch lost to Mike Jarrett & Jeremy Newton 1 dn;

The seniors found conditions equally testing with only four of 63 players equalling or bettering the CSS. Winner on countback was John Renwick from Ken Marjoram, both scoring nett 68s. Two former seniors captains tied for third place on 69, with Allen Sibley getting the nod over David Laver on countback.

There were seven twos. Leading scores: 68 John Renwick, Ken Marjoram; 69 Allen Sibley, David Laver; 70 David Heard, Mike Briant, Chris Hutchings, Peter Laws, Jim Booth.
