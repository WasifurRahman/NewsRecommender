FRESNO, Calif.
Near a playground at McKinley Elementary School, 10-year-old Donovan Rivas does a kind of victory dance. His rare connective tissue disease
which has caused holes in his lungs, back and neck pain due to scoliosis, four aneurysms in his aortic route, and requires that he wear foot and finger braces, and his stomach be flushed out every other day
doesnt keep him from enthusiastically dancing to one of his favorite songs: Silents Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae).Honestly, if you didnt know he had this disease, you probably wouldnt know at all, said his 16-year-old sister, Rayne Rivas. Hes such an outgoing kid. He acts and plays as if hes normal, even though hes not.Hes overall just an amazing kid.Rayne RivasDonovan likes to think of himself as unique.Some kids are lucky to have this disease, he said. What I mean by that is some things that other humans cant do, we can do, like praying behind our back and being flexible.(Donovan can amazingly put both his arms behind his back and touch his palms together, fingers pointed upward.) His mother, Kerry Rivas, says Donovan is among only 50 people in the world who have been genetically confirmed with having Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. It causes Donovans connective tissue, the glue that should hold everything together in his body, to become loose.His mother describes it like an old, stretched out rubber band. Instead of bouncing back into place, the rubber band keeps stretching. That makes it easier for Donovans joints to pop out of place. Your bones arent strong enough and its easy to get hurt.Donovan RivasPeople can support Donovan and his family during a fundraiser at 6 p.m. Friday, at NorthPointe Community Church. Money raised will go to support things that arent covered by the familys insurance, like a chest brace to keep Donovans bones in place, and annual trips to special medical conferences, where the Rivas family advocates for a cure.Kerry Rivas says the oldest known person with Donovans disease was in their 40s.Despite Donovans numerous surgeries
which included a skull operation to make his head larger as an infant
the Fresno boy has stayed positive.Hes wise beyond his years, his mother says. We had a friend that passed away from cancer, and getting ready to go to the funeral, he goes, Im excited about today. I said, What do you mean you are excited? He goes, We are going to celebrate Peters new birth in heaven. He was 8.Hes overall just an amazing kid.Rayne RivasStill, sometimes he feels down.In the hospital, I was like, Seriously, does this need to be happening? Donovan recalls. And sometimes I was just really heartbroken when I was in the hospital, not being able to see my dogs and do fun things.Thinking of his family helped him get through it.I like my family because they are nice and good people.Not being able to play on his schools baseball team also has been hard.I had to learn it was OK not being able to play baseball. I had to get through it. Hes taken the hardships and looked at them in a new light.Its cool being an inspiration to others. I hope to make people feel OK that they have this disease.He plans to keep doing just that during the Friday fundraiser.He has a message for people with his disease: Even though you arent like other people, you still have differences that make you stand out.Carmen George: 559-441-6386, @CarmenGeorge Donovans Disease Fight for the Cause A fundraiser will be held at 6 p.m. Friday, at Northpointe Community Church, 4625 W. Palo Alto Ave., Fresno, to support Donovan and his familys push to find a cure for Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. The event includes comedian Kerri Pomarolli, dessert and a silent auction. Items to be auctioned include hot air balloon rides and Disneyland tickets. Tickets are $12 and available online at donovansdisease.com/fundraiser_info.html.
