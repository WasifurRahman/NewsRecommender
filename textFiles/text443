The 30-year-old man butchered his three children, including
a three-month-old baby in Gorun Bandiremi village, Yeldu Local
Government Area of Kebbi State. The dastardly act threw residents of
the sleepy community into confusion.
According to Sun News, the killer father, Idi Mamman Dankarami, was
said to have used a machete to butcher his children ages four, three
and three months, with blood flowing all over the place.
Sources said the innocent kids comprising two males and a female,
were dispatched to their untimely death at about 2pm of the fateful day
as villagers watched in awe while their demented father embarked on the
killing spree.
It is, however, suspected that the man had gone insane, a
condition that might have propelled him to kill his children, Shansu
Mamman, Fatihu Mamman and Sharifah Mamman, the three- month -old
female baby.
It was learnt that after committing the act, Idi jumped into a
nearby well in an apparent suicide attempt, but was reportedly brought
out by some villagers who rushed him to a psychiatric hospital at Jega,
where he is currently being monitored by the police pending when his
condition improves to face prosecution.
A top police officer at the State police command who does not want
to be mentioned said Idi would face murder charges whenever he is
certified fit to stand trial.
