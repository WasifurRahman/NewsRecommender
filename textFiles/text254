65% of Americans traveling outside the U.S. will use mobile data to check in with loved ones back home
[May 03, 2016]
65% of Americans traveling outside the U.S. will use mobile data to check in with loved ones back home

NEW YORK, May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --A new survey reveals one in three Americans is planning to travel outside of the U.S. in the next year. Of those traveling internationally, a whopping 80 percent plan to use their phone and data on their phone with 65 percent checking in with loved ones at some point during their trip, according to a new survey released today by Verizon.
Here's some good news for world travelers: taking your phone with you just got easier. TravelPass is now available in more than 100 countries, letting you use your existing voice and data plan outside of the U.S. for as little as $2 per day, per line* to talk, text, surf the web and more.
"When traveling abroad, Americans are all about staying connected to those back home, looking up directions and posting photos onto social media through the use of mobile data,"said Rob Miller, vice president of consumer pricing for Verizon. "TravelPass has been in the marketplace for less than six months and already we have seen a sharp spike in usage, as it allows people to use their device outside of the U.S. as they would back home."

A surge in international data usageIn March of 2015, Verizon customers outside the U.S. averaged 18 MB per day. In March of 2016, that number jumped to 67 MB per day for travelers with TravelPass--a 272 percent increase in the average data usage per day.

So where are TravelPass users jetting off to? Since its launch in November 2015, the top 10 visited countries by TravelPass users include: Mexico, Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Jamaica, Australia and Israel.
Top-visited country Mexico has seen a remarkable 880 percent increase in the average data usage per day for travelers with TravelPass, from 5 MB per day in March of 2015 to 49 MB per day in March of 2016.
Canada has seen similar data usage year-over-year growth. In March of 2015, Verizon customers averaged 8 MB per day. In March of 2016, that number jumped to 80 MB per day for travelers with TravelPass. That's a 900 percent increase in the average data usage per day.
