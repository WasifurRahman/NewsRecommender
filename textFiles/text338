KANSAS CITY, Kan.
A suspended Kansas City, Kansas, lawyer has been sentenced for misappropriating money from a disabled man's trust fund.The Wyandotte County prosecutor's office says 65-year-old Don Charles Ball, of Parkville, Missouri, was ordered Friday to serve 60 days of shock time in the Wyandotte County jail and to pay more than $38,000 in restitution. He may avoid further incarceration if he successfully completes 36 months of intensive probation.Prosecutors say Ball managed the affairs of a man with a disabling brain injury. The man had a trust and a probate judge ordered Ball to not spend trust proceeds without court approval. When the court ordered Ball to pay out money in the trust, he wrote a $32,000 check that the bank rejected for insufficient funds.
