Setting Sail: Storms, spring racing and signs of summer
The RS200 spring championships at Itchenor / Picture by Mary Pudney

Have your say
Our racing programme is up and running at Itchenor with all of our classes now putting out sizable fleets since the first tentative outings on the weekend before Easter, writes Chris Blevins, rear-commodore sailing at Itchenor Sailing Club.
Good Friday provided champagne conditions to reward the growing fleets
then Storm Katie visited us. This put paid to the rest of the Easter programme.
Fortunately, the club suffered little damage other than a few dinghies that took an involuntary trip around the staging.
We celebrated the start of the season with a full programme of class racing and a party. With some 80 boats racing and a host of supporting craft, we made our target to get 100 boats on the water. The party, complete with a live band, was enjoyed by nearly 200 members.
We were proud to host the RS200 Spring Championships last weekend. The success of our sailors on the RS200 circuit and Itchenors reputation for high quality racing and race management gave us this opportunity. A total of 30 boats entered and enjoyed some exciting, close racing. A key date in our diary is Sunday, May 22, when we will be throwing open our doors to welcome potential new members to our open day.

Visitors will be guided around our clubhouse, where they will see our recently-upgraded accommodation in addition to sampling the delights of the bar and buttery. They will also be able to discuss the merits of each class of boat we sail at Itchenor with class representatives.
On-the-water activity will be a key element of the day. There is a programme of racing in the morning for visitors to observe but, more importantly, opportunities to go afloat in our wide range of boats throughout the day.Not only is our weekend racing up and running, but Wednesday and Thursday evening racing is also providing members and guests a chance to enjoy Chichester Harbour when it is often at its most beautiful.
