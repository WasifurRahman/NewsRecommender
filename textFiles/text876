First post long term looker.
I am applying for my first OA visa, but am confused, what exactly does the notary officer need to do, I have contacted one and he is unsure, he says he can certify copies of the originals but if I have the original, why would I need copies. Any and all replies will be welcome, even the nasty and stupid ones, I'm thick skinned and like a good joke.
Many thx

You need copies of the documents for each of application form you have to submit. Norm is one original and 3 copies of the application form.
