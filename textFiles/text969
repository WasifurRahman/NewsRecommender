Residents sound off at public hearing on inn
Residents sound off at public hearing on inn

CHARLESTOWN
A passionate mix of support and concern about the upcoming $1.75 million referendum on the towns purchase of the General Stanton Inn and an adjacent property dominated a packed public hearing on the budget Monday.
Dick Sartor, chairman of the Friends of the General Stanton Inn, a citizens group that put forward the referendum, explained that the idea to purchase the two properties grew out of a desire to preserve the inn, create a signature, characteristic village district, and to structure the property as a self-sustaining facility.
From this section:
Music helps kids shake off testing stress
If the voters approve the referendum, members of the group plan to run the inn, which dates back to 1667, solely as a museum, said resident Ron Meneo. They also plan to operate the flea market, which they estimate will produce enough revenue to maintain the property along with rental income on a separate building on the premises.
Sartor added that other communities, such as Narragansett, Portsmouth, Bristol, and Westerly, had purchased properties that were managed by friends groups.
Its a very common pattern in Rhode Island, he said.
Former Town Councilor Paula Anderson said preserving the towns historic buildings was equally as important as protecting its natural resources.
What is historic and worth saving? Simply put, historic means old and worth the trouble. In this case it applies to a building that is part of our communitys very tangible past
it should be preserved and protected for present and future generations, she said. We protect our natural landscapes, fields, farms, and water. Protecting our historic buildings should be another arm of the plan.
Planning Commission member Frances Topping said she was neither for nor against the towns purchase of the properties, but had many questions.
If the referendum passes are we still obligated to buy it? And, long-term, if the friends group doesnt work, can the town sell the property she asked. Who has the liability and responsibility for the building
is it the friends group or the town? And, what are the safeguards if the town were to enter into such an agreement?
Topping said she hopes more information becomes available before the referendum.
Resident Lorna Persson said she spoke for Charlestown residents who were uncomfortable voicing opposition to the project.
Im representing the underrepresented population of Charlestown. I got responses from other people in the town who felt they couldnt speak up publicly because they are a business owner or a practitioner and they dont want to offend their clients, their business base, she said. This is an organized group with resources and theres no equal to that in the opposition, and a lot of people who oppose it dont feel free to speak.
She added that the process was way too rushed and, with just a few weeks to the June 6 referendum, the opposition didnt have time to get information out to the public.
Its a well-established organization. Theyre ready to publish and send out literature
the townspeople dont have time to respond, she said. Theyre putting something in front of the town for a vote that the other townspeople dont have time to digest the material or organize themselves to get out literature that might state an opposing position. Its very premature and very rushed. I think that needs to be taken into consideration before it goes to a vote.
Town Administrator Mark Stankiewicz said the town charter allows for petitions to be placed on the ballot if 200 signatures are collected in support.
This was a petition article. They got the required signatures, and once that was put in place, this question is going on the ballot regardless of what happens with the Town Council or this public hearing tonight, he said. Its compulsory, they dont have any discretion as to whether or not this goes on the ballot. Procedurally, it is on the ballot automatically.
Stankiewicz added that citizens only have the opportunity to force a financial petition in conjunction with the towns budget referendum in June
not during a November election.
