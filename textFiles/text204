Theres a new body-coloured sports bar, which visually shifts the double cab rearwards and also extends over portions of the load platform.Although no picture has been released, Volkswagen says the interior has also been updated with an all-new dashboard, and new ergonomic seats. It also boasts features such as Park Distance Control parking assistant, which utilises a rear-view camera and Automatic Post-Collision Braking System as standard.In Europe, the Amarok will be offered with three different drive-system versions; a rear-wheel drive, and a 4Motion version with either rear-wheel drive and an engageable front axle in combination with a manual gearbox, or with a permanent all-wheel drive system and a Torsen differential and the eight-speed automatic gearbox.VW is also offering a Servotronic variable ratio steering system and larger brakes front and back as standard.Although VW Middle East has confirmed that there are no plans to bring the diesel version here at all, European buyers will now get an additional litre of displacement with the new 3.0-litre V6, which, in top Aventura trim, will put out 224bhp and 550Nm of torque at revs as low as 1,500rpm.
