Gov. BillHaslam said Monday he is allowing acontroversialguns-on-campusbillto become law without his signature.The billallows full-time faculty, staff and other employees of Tennessee's public colleges and universities who have handgun-carry permits to carry their guns on campus -- but they must notify the local law enforcement agency with primary responsibility forsecurity on their campus -- the campus police, for example.The governor said in a letter to the House and Senate speaker that he prefers to let campuses make their own decision.I am letting SB 2376 become law without my signature. I have long stated a preference for systems and institutions to be able to make their own decisions regarding security issues on campus, and I again expressed this concern throughout the legislative process this year," he said in a statement. "Although SB 2376 does not go as far as I would like in retaining campus control, the final version of the bill included input from higher education and was shaped to accommodate some of their concerns."Any employee interested in carrying a weapon on campus would be required to notify the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the property and would face some limitations as to where they can carry a gun, which would have to be concealed.Valid permit holders could not bring a weapon intoa stadium or gymnasium during school-sponsored events or in meetings regarding discipline or tenure.The legislation was also amended to place liability on the permit holder rather than the university in the event of an accidental discharge.Discussing those provisions, Haslam said,Ultimately, this legislation was tailored to apply to certain employees in specific situations, it provides protection from liability for the institutions, and it requires notification of law enforcement before carrying on campus.I hope that as a state we will monitor the impact of this new law and listen to the feedback of higher education leaders responsible for operationalizing it.Prior to Monday's announcement, the legislation was considered one of a handful of bills Haslam was considering vetoing since the legislature adjourned on April 22.Proponents of the measure argued it is necessary in order to provide additional safety on college campuses. Opponents, including police chiefs,studentsand a significant number offaculty members at the University of Tennessee, said the legislation would not actually make the campus safer and would complicate how law enforcement handleactive shooter incidents.The bill does not allow students, including those with permits, to go armed on campus, as some states, such as Texas,have allowed.However, a separate bill approved earlier this year and signed by the governor prohibits state colleges and universities from taking "adverse action" against students and employees with permits for transporting or storing a gun or ammunition in their parked vehicles on campus.The campus carry lawrequires campus employees with permits to carry their guns concealed, even though Tennessee's handgun-carry permit law allows open and concealed carry.According to estimates university officials provided The Tennessean inJanuary, the legislation meansall 11,527 full-time employees at the University of Tennessee and15,985 employees in the Tennessee Board of Regents system,which oversees 46 institutions across the state, couldcarry a weapon on college property, including inside classrooms and lecture halls.The bill, which won Senate approval 28-5 on April 19 and House approval the following day on a 69-24 vote, goes into effect July 1.The measure gives law enforcement agencies with jurisdictions overeach campus authority to develop and implement policies and procedures regarding the law's requirement that employees notify law enforcement of their intent to go armed, and to offer voluntary courses or supplemental firearm training to employees who elect to go armed.University of Tennessee President Joe DiPietro said UT's "position has been and continues to be that we do not support, as a general premise, any measure that would increase the number of guns on college campuses other than already are allowed by law. To us, the governors position of allowing the two higher education boards to decide for themselves gun policy for their campuses would have been ideal."But we recognized early in the process that the bill had a great likelihood of passing. We went to work with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police and our colleagues at the Tennessee Board of Regents on attempts to try to craft some sort of amendment to maximize campus safety in the event of passage. That measure is that university employees who intend to go armed must notify their campus police departments, DiPietro said.David Gregory, the chancellor for the Tennessee Board of Regents,said the focus will now turn ensuring the guidelines of the law are followed."We pray that anyone who chooses to carry a gun on a college campus intently complies with all safety practices, legal guidelines and defined restrictions to help avoid accidents," hesaid.The two legislative sponsors of the bill said Monday they appreciated the governor's action, even if he didn't sign it, and said they believe it will make public colleges safer.Sen.Mike Bell, R-Riceville, the Senate sponsor, said,"I appreciate the governor recognizing that myself and the House sponsor did work with the UT and TBR (Tennessee Board of Regents) systems and accepted some of their amendments, which I think made it a better bill."The House sponsor, Rep.Andy Holt, R-Dresden, said he is pleased that Haslam "is allowing this bill to become law and fulfilling the wishes of the 109th General Assembly and Tennesseans in general.""The purpose of running the bill is campus safety. It's not an effort to create an armed battalion on campus but to allow individuals to protect and defend themselves," Holt said.Holtalso said hebelieves the "important next step" is to allow studentsto go armed on campus as well. "It's not my intention to do so immediately. But if someone else did, Id support it. These are adults. We need to stop talking about college students as children. They have the same constitutional rights as others. I think thats an important next step."My intention is to eliminate all gun-free zones, whether its the legislature or a college campus," Holt said.Bell said he expects a student-carry bill to be filed next year but that he won't sponsor it.Tennessee Democratic Party chair Mary Mancini criticized Haslam's decision, saying allowing guns on college campuses defies common sense."Campus police chiefs have also opposed this legislation vehemently so the only conclusion to be made is that the Governor and the Republican supermajority who passed this horrific piece of legislation only care about the gun lobby and their wealthy donors," she said.Sen.Lee Harris, D-Memphis, who surveyed 1,700universityfaculty members, many of who criticized the measure, before the legislation was approved in the Senate, expressed his frustration onsocial media.
Statement on Governor allowing Guns on Campuses to become law: pic.twitter.com/UqGluSuPnO Senator Lee Harris (@SenDemLeaderTN) May 2, 2016 "Make no mistake, special interest groups and the opinions of a very small minority of Tennesseans drive decisions like this one," Harris said on Twitter.Beth Joslin Roth, policy director of Safe Tennessee Project and who monitored the bill through the legislative process, said lawmakers should have listened to campus police chiefs who spoke against the bill in committees."According to campus police chiefs, not only will this new law make campuses less safe, it will also require them to scrap their FBI training protocol when it comes to responding to an active shooter situation. Additionally, numerous faculty members have indicated they will resign over this. But, in our state, the gun lobby is more influential than law enforcement and the wishes of the NRA trump the concerns of our public colleges and universities," Roth said.Adam Tamburin contributed to this report.Richard Locker of The Commercial Appeal in Memphis and Knoxville News Sentinelcontributed to this report.This story originally appeared on The Tennesseans website
