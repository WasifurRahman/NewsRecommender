Art in the great outdoorsPresented byDr James FoxArt historian & PresenterIn association withForest, Field And Sky:Art Out Of Nature
As an art historian, I spend a lot of my life inside art galleries and museums. But a lot of Britain's most inspiring art can actually be found in our amazing landscape.
Some of this art is called land art because it's made from the most basic natural materials like dirt, rocks and trees and can inspire you to think differently about the world you see around you every day. Exploring art in the outdoors doesnt only stimulate the mind
it also allows you to get some fresh air and exercise at the same time.
I've had a fantastic time visiting some of Britain's greatest examples of land art for BBC Four. But you can discover many of them first hand too
whether its land art or different kinds of sculptures. So where can you find great outdoor art in Britain?
