Is it just me, or is happened to anyone else? I had 18,283,533 credits, and sold a extra expansion 6 for 750,00 credits, but when I look at my credits afterward, I only see 18,039,533 credits. Apparently the game either took 1M after i got my credits, or it just subtracted my credits by 244,000.

Look in the Uridium page at the Balance tab it will show all credit and uridium activity.
You may have had an automatic purchase of something happen that you forgot about.
I buy eco-10 rockets with my Rocket Buy Cpu and my us3 account buys LCB-10 ammo with his Laser Buy Cpu.
Not saying this is the situation but is a possibility.

I checked the balance page, and it said +750,000, but it still was 18M and I don't use auto purchases.
