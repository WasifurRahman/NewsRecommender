Its a tough morning on the roads Tuesday.
A steady rain is causing decreased visibility and slippery road conditions.
Already, weve had an number of accidents during the AM commute.
The first accident, reported shortly before 6 a.m., happened on the Moses Wheeler Bridge in Milford. The two-vehicle motor vehicle accident on southbound I-95 has closed the right and center lanes between Exits 34 and 32. About an hour later, only the right lane is blocked. Southbound traffic was backed up more than two miles before the crash.
There was also a northbound crash near Exit 22 in Fairfield that has shut down the left lane.
On I-95 southbound traffic is congested more than 20 miles from Exit 31 in Stratford ti Exit 11 in Darien.
There are more than 16 miles of heavy traffic on the southbound Merritt Parkway.
