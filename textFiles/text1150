Brazil prosecutor asks for probe of opposition leader NevesNeves was included in a list of some 50 politicians suspected to have taken bribes from state-run companiesPublished: 12:31 May 3, 2016 ReutersAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisSao Paulo: Brazils top prosecutor asked the Supreme Court to open an investigation on opposition Senator Aecio Neves on Monday as a vast corruption probe ensnares more politicians.Neves, who narrowly lost the 2014 election to President Dilma Rousseff, was previously included in a list of some 50 politicians thought to have taken bribes originating from state-run companies.Brazils Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot had stopped the investigation of Neves last year but is now asking to reopen it based on plea bargain testimony from another senator, Delcidio do Amaral. Janot also requested an investigation of congressman Marco Maia of the ruling Workers Party and of a judge at the TCU audit court.A spokesman for Neves, the leader of the centrist Social Democracy Party (PSDB), said the investigation would show his conduct was correct. Maia said in a statement he was the victim of a lie. Amaral, the governments former leader in the Senate, said in plea bargain testimony that Neves benefited from a corruption scheme involving Furnas, a subsidiary of state-run power utility Eletrobras.The scheme was similar to one that police uncovered at state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, according to Amaral. Construction executives worked together to overcharge Petrobras for work and used the excess funds to bribe politicians.Amaral is collaborating with prosecutors after he was arrested and accused of obstructing the corruption investigation, Brazils largest-ever.The scandal has increased calls for President Dilma Rousseffs ouster though she is not under investigation for taking bribes herself. The leaders of both houses of Congress, who belong to a party that used to be an ally of Rousseffs government, are under investigation.Rousseff is waiting for the Senate to vote on whether to open a trial for her ouster this month after the lower house voted overwhelmingly to impeach her on charges of breaking budgetary laws.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from Brazil Brazil prosecutor asks for probe of Neves 12:31 pmRio exhibit celebrates Brazils first flightBrazils people will prevent setbacksRousseff cites sexism in impeachmentPossible next Brazil leader is scandal-taintedTorture-praising politician seizes limelightRousseff vows to keep fighting impeachment bidSenator with hairy past oversees Rousseff fate tags from this storyBrazilfollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsNewsAmericasBraziltagsBrazilfollow this tag on MGN+MGNAlso In BrazilBrazil bans WhatsApp
