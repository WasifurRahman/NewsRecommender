Indian police arrest forest guards over rhino poachingAt least seven rhinos have been killed in Kaziranga so far this yearPublished: 16:23 May 3, 2016 AFPAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisGuwahati: Indian police said Tuesday they have arrested four forest guards on suspicion of helping to cover up rhino poaching in a national park visited by Britains Prince William and his wife last month.The arrests relate to an incident last year, but came as wildlife officials said a gang of poachers armed with automatic weapons had killed another rhino on Monday in the Kaziranga National Park in the northeastern state of Assam.The four arrested guards were suspected of covering up the killing of a rhino last November, Kaziranga wildlife warden Suvasish Das told AFP by telephone.Police said they had failed to report the killing and had buried the carcass with its horn removed.Based on specific information, we managed to recover the carcass on Monday after digging up the site, said a senior police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.This led to the arrest of seven people including the four forest guards.The other three are locals living around the park, home to the worlds largest concentration of rare one-horned rhinoceros.At least seven rhinos have been killed there so far this year. Across the state, the figure is 13.Images of the park, a major tourist attraction, shot around the world last month when Britains Duke and Duchess of Cambridge went on safari and fed rhino and elephant calves there during a tour of India and neighbouring Bhutan.The states forests minister Atuwa Munda said he had ordered an investigation into the alleged collusion of forest guards in poaching.We will take stern action against anyone found [to be involved] in incidents of rhino poaching, he said.Kaziranga has fought a sustained battle against rhino poachers who kill the animals for their horns, which fetch huge prices in China and Vietnam where they are deemed to have aphrodisiac and cancer-curing qualities.A recent census estimated there were 2,500 one-horned rhinos in the park out of a global population of around 3,300.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from Government India: Forest guards held over rhino poaching11 minutes agoUAEs publishing foot print to be increased50 minutes agoUAE Year of Reading: timeline03:33 pmUAEs National Policy for Reading launched03:21 pmNew centre for Quran memorisation opens20 minutes agoJawaher praises efforts of UAE leadership25 minutes agoPope Francis and Joe Biden praise UAE24 minutes agoMohammad Bin Zayed receives scholars tags from this storyIndiafollow this tag on MGNChinafollow this tag on MGNUnited Kingdomfollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsNewsUAEGovernmenttagsIndiafollow this tag on MGN+MGNChinafollow this tag on MGN+MGNUnited Kingdomfollow this tag on MGN+MGNforexAlso In GovernmentUAEs publishing foot print to be increased Follow usMost Popular
