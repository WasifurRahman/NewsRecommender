May 3, 2016
SOCIALISM: IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL LEAVE:
Survey says: 34 percent of Bay Area residents are ready to leave.
Black Residents Matter: Theyre fleeing the most progressive citieswhy?
Because unless youre a One Percenter yourself, you can only stay on the front lines of the lefts self-admitted mission to rid society of the dictatorship of the middle class, for so long.

It's curious the way that the Left simultaneously sucks up to the middle class while finding middle class people so icky, tacky, and gauche. Sounds like the Left just wants votes and obedience.
Hmmm.....maybe they've tried that with A.A.'s and the po' folks and it worked, so they're extending the same strategy.

Sadly, the fools never understand how it got so bad, so like locusts they move on to destroy the next field when the current field has been reduced to dust, then act all surprised when the new field becomes as barren as the last. When your understanding of how things work and where stuff originates is based on a "food comes from a grocery store" mindset, you'll never get it.
Ever.
