Many fast-growing, successful firms with booming digital operations might have been forgiven for leaving their old offices behind for premises in bigger cities.

and committing its future to the Suffolk coastal town.The company started on an Oulton Broad boatyard owned by Wally Hoseason in the 1940s and has sold an ever-expanding portfolio of holidays from its Raglan Street premises for many years.The money it has spent on its new Woods reception and staff social area, officially unveiled by Waveney MP Peter Aldous last Friday and attended by about 70 people from the community, is designed to give people the wow-factor and make staff feel pride in where they work. But the move, part of a 1million investment in its headquarters over the past six years, also reflects its history in the area and confidence in the town.Official opening of the newly refurbished Hoseasons reception area by local MP Peter Aldous.

noting that Persimmon Homes Anglia has decided to move from Oulton Broad to the Broadland Business Park.However he said: From our perspective, weve got to think back to our heritage. The business was started by Wally Hoseason on Oulton Broad years ago. When youve got a close affinity with the town, its like a long-term relationship
and long-term relationships arent easy to get out of.The staff here are fiercely proud of being based in Lowestoft and the majority live and work in the area
were only pulling in about 20 per cent from Norwich.People here are passionate about being based in Lowestoft and being part of Hoseasons history.Asked whether Lowestoft was the place to be for business in the future, Mr Altham said: Its very hard to crystal ball gaze but things can only get better.Having a successful business like Hoseasons in Lowestoft is great for the town. I think a lot of people forget how competitive Lowestoft is. Theres a great talent pool here. Its lovely to be able to show that commitment to the area.He added that the Raglan Street premises still has plenty of room should the firm need to expand.What contribution do you think Hoseasons makes to the town?
