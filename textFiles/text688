NewsShrimp Prices Drop by 50 Per Cent in Khulna 29 August 2012 BANGLADESH - More than 0.2 million shrimp cultivators of southwestern region are in frustration due to sharp fall in price of produced shrimp in the local market. Shrimp is now being sold at Tk. 400-500 per kg in place of Tk. 900-1000 even in last one a and half month ago, reports
FinancialExpress.
The shrimp farmers allege that this situation has been created by a dishonest syndicate of shrimp processing units and exporters. But the exporters said that price has been fallen in the international market due to global economic recession. As a result the target of export of frozen foods would not be achieved.
Cultivators sources said a virus affected the shrimp farms in southwestern region from the beginning of this season. Moreover, production cost of shrimp has been increased several times due to price hike in hatchery feed, medicine and wages of workers. As a result the shrimp farms are on the verge of closure.
Managing Director of Bagerhat Sea Food SM Abul Hossain said that the price of shrimp has come down by 50 per cent in the international market due to global economic recession. The price of shrimp was 16-17 US dollar per kg in US, UK and European countries during the last year and now it is being sold at 8-9 US dollar per kg.
District fisheries office source said that about 0.2 million shrimp ghers are in Khulna, Bagerhat and Satkhira district.
