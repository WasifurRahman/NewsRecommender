HP has announced a new family of Chromebooks, which are powered by Intels high-performance processors and feature stylish design, aluminum body, high-resolution display and even Bang & Olufsen speakers. The new laptops will not be as affordable as many other mobile PCs running Google Chrome OS and will not be as powerful as Googles Pixel,however, this is what HP believes to be the right balance between performance, style, portability and price.
When Acer and Samsung introduced their first notebooks based on Googles Chrome OS in mid-2011, they praised their low price and mainstream computing capabilities. At the time, Chrome OS was a mystery for most people, netbooks were relatively popular and it made sense for the aforementioned PC makers and Google to address the entry-level segment of the market with something very affordable. As Chrome OS gained traction, PC makers began to install higher-performing components into their Chromebooks. However, they were still not ready to address the high-end market segment with such PCs, which is why Google released its Pixel laptop in 2013. The Chromebook Pixel is one the most advanced and stylish Chromebooks ever made because of its Core i7 Broadwell CPU, a display with 25601700 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio. But, the Pixel costs $999 and not all users are ready to invest that sum in a Chromebook. Fortunately, different PC makers offer various systems that attempt to replicate some of the Pixels features. HP decided to build its own competitor for Googles Pixel and while the product is not exactly affordable, it has a better screen than most Chromebooks and a number of other advanced features.
The HP Chromebook 13 sports a 13.3 IPS display with 32001800 resolution (QHD+), 170-degree viewing angles and 16:9 aspect ratio, which is good for multimedia applications and video. HPs latest Chromebook comes in brushed anodized aluminum chassis, it is 12.9 mm thick and weighs 1.29 kilograms (2.86 pounds), which is thinner and lighter than Apples MacBook Air 13. Despite thevery high resolution screen, the laptop works up to 11.5 hours on one charge of its 45 Wh battery, according to the manufacturer.
To enable long battery life, HP used Intels Skylake-Y system-on-chips to build its Chromebook 13. Various versions of the system are powered by either Pentium or Core M SoCs with two cores, Intels HD Graphics 515 (Gen9) core with 24 EUs (execution units) as well as 6W or 4.5W TDP. The system will likely be considerably faster than other Chromebooks running Atom, Celeron or Pentium processors because of the high-performance CPU architecture.

Depending on the model and price, the HP Chromebook 13 can be equipped with 4, 8 or 16 GB of RAM, an unknown amount of solid-state storage as well as wireless connectivity technologies (a 802.11ac Wi-Fi module with Bluetooth 4.2 is likely, but is not confirmed by HP). HP notes that its system has a full-sized backlit keyboard as well as Band & Olufsen-tuned speakers, which is something new for a Chromebook. The system also has a webcam, three microphones, a 3.5 mm audio port, aSD card reader, one USB Type-A port as well as two USB Type-C ports. The Chromebook 13 uses USB-C for charging and is therefore compatible with a variety of third-party chargers.
With its advanced Chromebook 13, HP offers its Elite USB-C Docking Station ($149), which plugs in to a USB-C port on the PC and enables to connect up two Full HD displays, Gigabit Ethernet as well as multiple USB Type-A devices, such as keyboards or mice.
Four versions of the HP Chromebook 13 should hit the U.S. retail shortly. The most basic model running the Intel Pentium 4405Y processor and equipped with 4 GB of RAM will cost $499, whereas the top-of-the-range system featuring the Intel Core m7-6Y75 and 16 GB of RAM will cost $1029, which is even more than Googles Pixel.

TWEETS
IanCutress: @anshelsag Two usual questions: does it detect non-living items, and how much battery? Then the other Q's: implementation, cost etc etc
IanCutress: @GenericDudeBARF Synthetic, no. Real world is significantly blurred. DRAM differences are usually small in RW.
IanCutress: @n_halls No-one ever said Atom was dead. Atom was in many things, only the Broxton SoC was canceled.
ganeshts: @Bindibadgi Surprised to see X-Gene move to a non-SoC model. Always thought that was the main attraction of ARM in servers.
ganeshts: @Bindibadgi Is AMCC getting any traction with Helix? IIRC, they were the first ones to bring out ARM-based server platforms
ganeshts: @Bindibadgi Numbers? Given Xeon-D SiP vs. ARM SoC at similar TDPs, hard to go against existing SW infrastructure / higher perf, I guess
RyanSmithAT: However we're still not entirely clear on the impact of Apollo Lake vs. Willow Trail. Whether features/perf/power are different, etc
RyanSmithAT: A quick update from @intel PR today: confirmed that Apollo Lake will be offered to tablet customers. So we will see Goldmont tablets
RyanSmithAT: @Florent_ATo Gbps is correct. Due to how various memory techs differ (double/quad data rate, etc), GPU vendors are measuring in Gbps/pin
ganeshts: @oblong_furlong Wait till Apollo Lake comes along..
ganeshts: @davezatz Consider Kuna. Another option for same use-case, works by replacing/adding-on to an outdoor light, same revenue model as Ring
RyanSmithAT: @Krewell @IanCutress Oh it's a huge deal. However Atom is much more than just SoFIA. B-well was in a lot of things; I expect the same for AL
IanCutress: Amazed. Many sites say 'Intel drops atom/quits SoCs'. Only Broxton/SoFIA canceled. Goldmont+Apollo Lake still coming https://t.co/dBai0a0GVS
IanCutress: Bunny https://t.co/cXStl51VfH
RyanSmithAT: @chrisheinonen I will have to grab a bag of regular and double stufs to test this. For science, of course...
