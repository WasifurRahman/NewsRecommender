Northern Utahns continue to clean up after weekend hurricane-force winds (gusts exceeding 74 mph) in Davis and Weber counties ripped up trees, demolished fences, and tossed trampolines and lawn furniture around like kale in a blender.
The National Weather Service on Sunday recorded a 91 mph gust at its U.S. 89-Park Lane station on Ogden, while Farmington and Centerville came in with readings of 87 and 81 mph. Snowbasin hit 75 mph, and the wind spun up a 70 in South Ogden. Salt Lake City and St. George recorded winds of 53 and 50 mph, respectively.
Wind-damaged or toppled power lines left more than 20,000 without electrical services late Sunday, and still more than 2,900 Ogden-area customers remained without power Monday afternoon, Rocky Mountain Power officials reported. At 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, less than 300 customers did not have electricity; full restoration of service was expected by noon.

On Monday, the power outage forced court officials to postpone hearings in Farmington's 2nd District Juvenile Court for most of the morning. Power was restored by about 11 a.m.
Lance Peterson, director of Weber County Emergency Management, said losses were still being assessed on Monday. "Most of it has been to private property, homes and trees," he said, adding that an unspecified amount of damage was reported to roofing at McKay-Dee Hospital, and Canyon View Elementary School, both in Ogden.
Ogden public works crews, meanwhile, were expected to face sidewalk repairs in a couple locations where large trees toppled, upending concrete in the process.
Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday visited five sites in Weber and Davis counties where residents were recovering from wind damage left behind by an overnight windstorm.
One of his stops was a green-waste collection site in Farmington where hundreds of volunteers were busy bringing in debris from toppled trees and busted branches.
"It's who Utah is and what we do," Herbert said of the volunteers. "When there's adversity, they step up and say, 'What can we do?' They don't wait on the government. They help each other."
