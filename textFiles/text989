Pakistan will acquire F-16 fighter jets from elsewhere if
the US does not arrange funding for the sale, Sartaj Aziz, the prime
minister's adviser on foreign affairs, cautioned the US as both
countries lock horns over the purchase of the multirole
warplanes.Pakistan had earlier reached an understanding with the US for
buying eight F-16 jets.
Under the deal, Pakistan was required to pay
about $270 million from its national fund. The US was supposed to
provide the rest from its Foreign Military Financing Fund.But at a
congressional hearing, US lawmakers last Wednesday made it clear that
they would not allow the Obama administration to use US funds for the
deal.Last Friday, a State Department official told Dawn that Congress
had placed a hold on the deal, forbidding the administration from using
US funds for enabling Pakistan to buy the warplanes.
On Monday, the
department confirmed that Pakistan will have to use its own funds if it
wants the planes.The latest announcement practically kills the deal as
Pakistan may find it difficult to buy the planes at a price that is
two-and-half times more than previously agreed.Aziz said Pakistan valued
the F-16s for their effectiveness, but said that they could be replaced
by JF-17 Thunder jets in its anti-terrorism campaign, Dawn reported.
The JF-17 Thunder fighter jet has been jointly developed by China's
Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and its Pakistani partner,
Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC).
