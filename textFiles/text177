Facebook algorithm changes will impact all publishers
ALGORITHMS: Facebookimproved algorithm will change the factors that establish what news are more relevant for the users, with obvious consequences for publishers, whether they signed up with Instant Articles or not. In addition, the source of the news will also be taken into account in an effort to avoid showing too many stories from the same source.Digiday looks into possible winners and losers of this move.
Facebook claims that the decision on how to change the algorithm was taken following indications coming from the users through theirFeed Quality Program. News Feed rankings will learn from past user behavior and take into account the time spent reading stories after clicking through on a piece of news, whether it is an Instant Article or an article in the mobile web browser.
What Facebook learned from their users surveys is that "the actions people take on Facebookliking, clicking, commenting or sharing a postdont always tell (...) the whole story of what is most meaningful to them and that "there are stories people dont like or comment on that they still want to see, such as articles about a serious current event, or sad news from a friend".
