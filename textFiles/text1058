Have your say
Hemel Town boss Dean Brennan experienced his worst 20 minutes in management after watching his sides National League South playoff dreams come to a shattering end against Whitehawk.
The Tudors slumped to a 3-0 defeat, handing Whitehawk the final playoff spot and leaving Hemel fans wondering what might have been as the game drifted to a disappointing conclusion.

They took their chances and they were clinical, whereas we missed some fantastic opportunities, said Brennan. They were just that bit classier than us with their finishing.
We were beaten by a better side, its that simple, because they have got better players than us who rose to the occasion, and I dont think ours did.
We defended poorly and it was disappointing the way the game ended in the last 20 minutes. It was probably the worst 20 minutes Ive had in management.Brennan is already looking towards next season, but admits he is yet to sit down and discuss plans with the board.I havent got a clue whats happening next season yet in terms of what resources we have got and what we are working with, because the club hasnt spoken to me yet, he said.Weve just got to find out what the football club wants, and where they want to be, and then we can move forward and start putting everything in place for next season.
We dont have the resources that other clubs have but Im not here just to be a mediocre manager, we set our standards high.The last two seasons in my eyes have been unsuccessful because football is all about winning titles. Im not trying to big myself up, thats just what I want to do.Ill be sitting down one-on-one with the players and letting them know who we want to stay at the club. Thats the hardest part of the job, but you have got to be honest if you want success moving forward.He continued: Im very disappointed because we targeted 90 points at the start of the season and we have finished 29 points short of that. Somehow we have got to make sure that we close that gap because we want success in this division.
