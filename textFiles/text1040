Havertys first-quarter profits fall amid slower sales growth
Larry Thomas-- Furniture Today, May 3, 2016
ATLANTA
Havertys said first-quarter profits fell more than 23% as sales growth slowed in some of its existing markets.
The Top 100 company said net sales were up 1.7% to $194.5 million, while comparable-store sales were up 0.9%.
First-quarter net income totaled $4.67 million or 21 cents per share. That was down from $6.12 million or 27 cents per share in last years first quarter.
Our expansion and remodeling strategy has yielded nine new locations and two significantly remodeled and expanded stores over the past 21 months. The sales results for these locations, including those in new markets, combined with the overall slower growth in some of our existing markets has not yet allowed us to outpace the additional fixed costs, said Clarence Smith, chairman, president and CEO.
Smith said the retailers new mobile-friendly website has seen strong increases in traffic and sales, and will be the catalyst for an array of email marketing efforts, search engine campaigns, display ads and social media efforts.
Custom-order upholstery continues to pace top-line growth, increasing 4% during the first quarter. The average written ticket was up 1.1%.
Smith said top-line growth has increased in the current quarter, noting that total delivered sales are up about 4.7% to date, compared with the same period last year, and comparable-store sales are up 4.5%.
With the continued uncertain economic and political climate, we are pleased that our top line growth has improved thus far in the seasonally weaker second quarter, he said. We are in a strong financial position and remain committed to increasing shareholder value.
