Joint campaign calls for a UN Special Representative for the Safety of Journalists
PRESS FREEDOM: On the World Press Freedom Day, 3 May, WAN-IFRA is calling attention to a campaign that calls for the creation of the role of UN Special Representative for the Safety of Journalists.
The campaign was launched by an international coalition, of which WAN-IFRA is part, that calls the UN and its member states to give this position the political weight, capacity for rapid action and legitimacy to coordinate UN efforts for the safety of journalists. This role at the highest level of the UN would hopefully facilitate compliance with the existing legal frameworks that already exist and that are designed for the protection of journalists.
WAN-IFRA will engage its community to help build a critical mass of support among foreign ministries and US ambassadors, so that the role has a clear mandate, is effective, and has real impact.
Moreover, a public campaign will collect declarations of support from within the media industry for the creation of a Special Representative. To voice your support, please go to the campaign website www.protectourjournalists.org, where you can read more about the initiative and endorse the recommendation.
