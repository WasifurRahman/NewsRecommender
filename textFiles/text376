It either boils or freezes.Identifying water on the Red Planet is complicated by our limited understanding of natural processes under conditions so different to those on Earth.In September last year, a team reported in the journal Nature Geoscience that curious lines running down slopes on the Martian surface in "summer" may be streaks of super-salty brine.They said they had found evidence in the lines of "hydrated" salt minerals, which require water for their creation.The lines, up to a few hundred metres in length and typically under five metres (16 feet) wide, appear on slopes during warm seasons, lengthen, then fade as they cool."Under certain circumstances, liquid water has been found on Mars," NASA concluded at the time.For the latest study, also published in Nature Geoscience, researchers took to the lab to try and explain how water could have made the lines.- 'Remarkably similar -The team, led by Marion Masse of the University of Nantes in France, included several of the authors of last year's headline-making study.They placed a block of ice on a 30-degree plastic slope covered with loose fine-grained sand, and allowed it to melt in a chamber in which Martian pressure and summer temperature was recreated.They repeated the experiment under Earth conditions to compare the processes.Under Martian pressure, they found, melting ice produced a liquid which boiled vigorously as it flowed downslope and filtered into the sand.The evaporating water vapour blasted grains upward, creating ridges which collapse onto themselves when they become too steep, forming channels."The morphologies produced on the sandy slopes in these experiments are remarkably similar to the streaks observed on Mars," Wouter Marra of the geosciences faculty of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands commented on the study."This process in which unstable boiling water causes grains to hop and trigger slope failures may underlie some of the active landforms observed on the Martian surface."A video of the experiment can be seen at: https://youtu.be/rIdr8KguNGc or https://youtu.be/ge1IaLViB_AReblogShareTweetPin itSendWhat to Read Next'DWTS' Pro Sharna Burgess Suffers Wardrobe Malfunction During Sexy Tango With Antonio BrownETonlineOlympic torch arrives in BrazilReuters VideosAshley Sawyer Dies: MTV Catfish Subject Was 23DeadlineDennis Hastert: a look back at the former House Speaker's careerYahoo NewsPolls open in Indiana primaryReuters VideosFlasher On Bus Gets Beating From Angry WomenAnthony Pearce's BlogBeyonce Ditches Jay Z and Her Wedding Ring for the Met Gala, Goes Flesh Tone With Latex DressETonlineOKC survives big mistakes in wild ending, takes Game 2 over SpursBall Don't LiePhotos of the day - April 12, 2016Yahoo NewsAP Top Stories May 3 AAssociated Press VideosKanye West Gave Off Major Wolf Vibes at the Met GalaLauren TuckDefense Secretary Carter: American killed in combat in IraqAssociated PressLady Gaga Dressed as Her Old Self at the Met GalaNora CrottyThe 36th annual Photography Show in New York CityYahoo NewsCustom Jeeps for Dubai's desert racersReuters VideosThe 2013 draft is looking more and more like a giant bustShutdown CornerThe FBI is hunting for a man who poured suspicious liquid on Whole Foods' buffetsBusiness InsiderWhat it was like in the bunker Hitler died in 71 years agoBusiness InsiderPhotos of the day - April 11, 2016Yahoo NewsBeyonce, Madonna and others arrive for the Met BallReuters VideosAlex Rodriguez and Anne Wojcicki Make Red Carpet Debut as a Couple at the Met GalaTaryn RyderUnconventional #9: Cruzs post-Indiana delegate problem, Sanders real strategy for a contested convention (and more!)Andrew RomanoKate Upton Is Engaged, Flaunts Huge Diamond Ring at Met GalaTaryn RyderBodypaint optical illusionsYahoo NewsBest Dressed at the 2016 Met GalaABC News Videos'GMA' 'Deals and Steals on Wheels' Visits Miami BeachGood Morning AmericaEx-49er Dana Stubblefield charged with raping disabled womanThe Associated PressHelpPrivacySuggestionsAbout our AdsTerms
