Sagacious Consultants Named Top Performer by KLAS for Epic Consulting Services
LENEXA, Kansas; May 3, 2016
Sagacious Consultants, now part of Accenture (NYSE: ACN), has been recognized as a top performer in KLAS 2016 Epic Consulting report, which assessed providers that specialize in consulting services for electronic health record (EHR) solutions from Epic Systems Corporation. Sagacious Consultants is ranked third, with a score of 92.9, in the Broad category of the report.
In addition, Sagacious Consultants is recognized for having the most validated projects and widest Epic module experience of all firms.
Sagacious Consultants is progressive, according to one client that KLAS surveyed for the report. They dont look at problems the way the rest of the industry does; they give their customers a different view. They have a very different approach for how they put their team together and how they craft different models for the customer to work with them.
To assess the performance of Epic consulting firms, KLAS compared 33 vendors in the categories of Enterprise Implementation and Leadership, Implementation Support and Staffing, Go-Live Support, and IT Advisory Services. The KLAS team compiled data through in-depth interviews with clinical, financial, and IT leadership and C-suite executives at healthcare organizations in North America.
We are proud that the strong skills and value that our consultants bring to clients continues to be recognized by industry influencers, said Shane Adams, managing director and founder of Sagacious Consultants. Our favorable positioning further reinforces that clients are seeing added value as a result of the acquisition by Accenture. Together, our leadership, knowledge and capabilities are helping provider organizations drive transformation as they adapt to the needs of an increasingly patient-centric, data intensive and connected industry.
