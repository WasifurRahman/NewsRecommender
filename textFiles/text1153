A Philippine senator has expressed alarm over a presidential front-runner's plan to allow communist guerrillas to participate in government if he wins, saying this would cause rumblings within the military.
In his latest controversial remark, Mayor Rodrigo Duterte told reporters his administration could be an all-inclusive one where communist guerrillas can take part in decision-making.
Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, a former navy officer, said the military, which has a history of failed coup attempts, could get restive if Duterte wins the presidential race and considers giving political concessions to the rebels.
Trillanes also says the tough-talking mayor failed a "truth test" when his bank accounts with suspected undeclared funds were not open for scrutiny Monday by signing a waiver to allow anti-graft officials to launch an inquiry.
