Therefore, we will put in mechanisms to categorise Arabic childrens books by age and content while we continue to build on what we have learned from developed countries, he said.Public library branches will open at popular shopping centres as these locations witness more foot fall, the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development announced.As of this year, a Month of Reading will be identified which will celebrate knowledge through festivals and author-focused events.Hussain Al Hammadi, Minister of Education, focused on the the role educators can play in encouraging children to develop the habit of reading.Educators play a pivotal role in motivating their students to read and so we will create an optional reading programme that encourages students to pick an age-appropriate book of choice to pursue over the holidays. The classroom can then be transformed into an environment for them to discuss what they have read with their teachers, said the minister. And when the weather permits, this discussion classroom can be moved to the outdoors, he added.Additionally, school assessments will become more focused on how facilities promote reading among their students. Under the edad (meaning preparation) training programme, educators will receive training on motivating their students to read, he added.Furthermore, digitalisation of books, said Mohammad Al Gergawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs and the Future, will help lower book prices.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from Society UAEs publishing foot print to be increased15 minutes agoUAE Year of Reading: timeline26 minutes agoUAEs National Policy for Reading launched38 minutes agoMan abuses wife and three-year-old daughter31 minutes agoMohammad Bin Zayed receives scholarsEmirati Islamic scholars graduateToy drum recalled over choking risk15 Ajman students rescued from floods tags from this storyUnited Arab Emiratesfollow this tag on MGNAbu Dhabifollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsNewsUAESocietytagsUnited Arab Emiratesfollow this tag on MGN+MGNAbu Dhabifollow this tag on MGN+MGNAlso In SocietyUAE Year of Reading: timeline Follow usMost Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures01Twins, triplets, and more in UAE02Expats worried about Bangladesh killings03Indian actor detained at Abu Dhabi Airport
