&nbspLeichtman: 65% of Homes Use a Streaming TV Deviceby Karl BodeTuesday May 03 2016 07:30 EDTAccording to the latest data from Leichtman Research, roughly 65% of all homes have at least one streaming device currently connected to their television set. That can be anything from a smart TV itself, to a game console, streaming stick, streaming box, or other device. The 65% mark is up dramatically from 44% of all households in 2013, and 24% of all households in 2010. The survey also found that 74% of homes have more than one device, with a mean of 3.3 streaming devices per connected TV household. By contrast, 77% of TV sets in pay-TV households have a pay-TV provider's set-top box, with a mean of 2.2 boxes per pay-TV household.Some additional findings of note from the study: 83% of households with any type of connected TV device get a pay-TV service -- similar to 81% with no connected TV devices 38% of adults with a pay-TV service watch video via a connected TV device at least weekly -- compared to 48% of pay-TV non-subscribers 79% of all TV sets in US households are HDTVs -- an increase from 34% of all TV sets in 2010, and 3% in 2004 33% of non-4K Ultra HDTV owners have seen one in use -- up from 10% in 2014 25% of those who have seen a 4K HDTV in use are interested in getting one -- compared to 9% of those who have not seen a 4K HDTV"Connected TV devices are now in nearly two-thirds of all TV households in the US, and there are actually more connected TV devices in US households than there are pay-TV set-top boxes," Bruce Leichtman said of the findings. "New forms of competition from Internet-delivered video via connected TVs, along with technological innovations in the pay-TV industry, are allowing consumers to choose more options for accessing and watching TV than they have ever had before."And, with a huge number of streaming services waiting it the wings, it's not a stretch to say that Internet video as a TV competitor is only just getting started. tags: competition

65% of Homes HAVE a Streaming TV DeviceHave a streaming TV Device and USE a streaming TV Device - quite two different thingsI can easily envision a family with xbox connected to tv and internet, but never use it for streaming video.That said, I forgot last time I watched live TV, oh I remember - watching ball drop at TimesSquare on xmas. Had plug antenna directly to TV just for that.Today 9 minutes ago::
