Fairway files for bankruptcy reorganization

Back to Gallery
Pledging no interruptions to customer service as it restructures its finances, the parent company of Fairway Market filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, wiping out $140 million in debt it owed lenders and asking for court approval for $55 million in new funding to carry on its operations.
Fairway Group Holdings has 15 grocery stores in the New York City market, including one on Canal Street in Stamford opened in November 2010 that remains its largest today, totaling more than 85,000 square feet of space. Limited liability companies for the Stamford store and its adjoining wine market are listed as debtors in the companys bankruptcy filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
Fairways chairman is Charles Santoro, managing partner of Westport-based Sterling Investment Partners which holds a majority stake in the parent company.
In a prepackaged bankruptcy reorganization, Fairway stated its suppliers, employees and others with unsecured claims will receive payment in full, and that its union contracts remain in full force. Fairway has created a hotline at (646) 616-8265 to field any questions from customers, and one for vendors at (844) 597-1421.
We are open for business. This ... doesnt change anything, wrote CEO Jack Murphy in a May 2 letter to vendors. We will continue to deliver the best food experience in New York ... We will pay for goods and services.

As of December 2015, the company had piled up an accumulated deficit of $441 million and had warned unless it could raise new funding and reach agreements on existing debt, there was substantial doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern.
