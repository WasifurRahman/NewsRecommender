Long-term review: Mercedes-Benz GLC - Week 3 By Fadi TakieddineAdded 12:54 | May 3, 2016 TweetPrintEmailShare Source:Stefan Lindeque/ANM Our long-termer may not be the manliest car around, but it is a well-rounded option. Bar an issue with the seats...At the risk of angering feminists, I have to say the GLC has school-run mum written all over it. Now, I am not for a minute suggesting that is an implication of its abilities, but rather an entirely subjective observation based on the way it looks. Wait, that sounds even worse...The point Im trying to make, badly, is that even though its elegant and striking in equal measures, to my eyes
all four of them
the GLC doesnt scream testosterone, like say, its rival the Lexus NX does.There are no angular styling details or an angry maw that might suggest its annoyed because youve just kicked its dog or something. Again, that is not a criticism, because these days when cars are generally over-styled
looking at you again, Lexus
the GLC comes across as quietly confident.Inside, its the usual Mercdes-Benz fare with generally great materials everywhere and loads of space. As a practical car it is pretty darn impressive. That said, it does fall short in some aspects in my view.Starting with the thigh-rest on the otherwise superb seats. Extended, it makes the positioning of the throttle pedal feel a little awkward and almost set too close to the floor-pan. My other complaint is that
and this is my only other comfort-related whinge
Im not sure that placing the fire extinguisher under the drivers seat was a great idea; it is constantly brushing against your calf muscles.Inside infoDriven by: FadiStart mileage: 9,747kmRecent cost: FuelAverage fuel economy: 12 litres per 100km Highs: Looks elegant, spacious and well appointed.Lows: Seating position.On the upside, you can hustle the GLC down a twisty road reasonably briskly. Having said that, I suspect its chief German foes such as the X3 and the Macan pack higher doses of schnell.Do I still think that it is deserving of our Premium Crossover of the Year accolade? I do indeed, especially given its base price of just Dh210,000. Niggles aside, the aforementioned BMW and the Porsche are noticeably more expensive and Im not sure if theyre that much better. It has a great balance of practical ability and elegance...The progressWeek 2 The engine sounds gruffer than you would expect, but in spite of the clatter it is an unexpectedly peppy car. Handles almost as well as the C-Class.Highs Driving dynamics.Lows Doesnt sound as refined as it should.Week 1 Winner of our Premium Crossover of the Year award, the GLC 300 arrives at the wheels HQ, bearing an unfeasible weight of expectation on its shoulders.Highs Great family SUV, CotY winner.Lows None so far.TweetPrintEmailShare More Long-term reviewsLong-term review: Mercedes-Benz GLC - Week 3Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 9Long-term review: Mercedes-Benz GLC - Week 2Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 8Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 7Long-term review: Mercedes-Benz GLC - Week 1Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 6Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 5Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 4Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 3Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 2Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 1Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 12Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 14Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 13Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 11Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 10Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 12Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 9Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 11
