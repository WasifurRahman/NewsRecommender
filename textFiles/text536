The Latest on global financial markets (all times local):11:50 a.m.
European stock markets have edged down after weak Chinese manufacturing figures stoked renewed concerns over the state of the world's number 2 economy.
The Caixin magazine's purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector declined to 49.4 points from March's 49.7 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting.
Worries over the state of the Chinese economy were largely responsible for the turmoil in global financial markets in the early part of the year, and the weak survey resonated round the world.In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares is down 1.1 percent at 6,176 while Germany's DAX has fallen 1.8 percent to 9,945. The CAC-40 in France is 1.6 percent lower at 4,372. Wall Street is also poised to open lower, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures down 0.7 percent.
