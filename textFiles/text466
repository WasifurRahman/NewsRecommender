Options narrow for Woodside Road fix: Interchange improvements at Highway 101 to cost $140M
May 03, 2016, 05:00 AM By Bill Silverfarb Daily Journal
The alternatives for improving traffic at the clogged Highway 101/Woodside Road interchange have narrowed to three and the public got to weigh in on them Thursday night.
One of the three options, however, is to do nothing at all, an unlikely scenario as city officials have been working for years with the state Department of Transportation to develop a design to improve conditions at the busy interchange.
The City Council will hold a study session May 9 to discuss the alternatives.
The two alternatives remaining include building a partial cloverleaf and diamond interchange or to build a diverging diamond interchange.
Either proposal will cost roughly $140 million, said the citys project manager Paul Krupka.
Krupka led the discussion at the Thursday night workshop attended by about 50 residents.
The partial cloverleaf with diamond alternative is called Alternative 3 in official city documents and would replace existing northbound ramps with a new slip on-ramp, loop on-ramp and diagonal off-ramp in a single partial cloverleaf ramp configuration.
The new ramps would connect with Woodside Road at a new signalized intersection.
The southbound ramps would be realigned and replaced with a single wider diamond configuration off-ramp and new on-ramp connecting with Woodside Road at a new signalized intersection.
The diverging diamond interchange, called Alternative 8B, would replace all existing ramp connections with diagonal ramps on both sides of Highway 101 in a diverging diamond configuration.
Woodside Road would be reconfigured to allow eastbound and westbound traffic to cross to the opposite side of the road and back again between two new signal intersections.
Both alternatives call for the addition of constructing paths for bicyclists.
Krupka started on the project in January 2014.
The environmental impact report has been released and the public has until May 26 to comment on it.
The release of the report is a major milestone for the project, Krupka said Friday.
Thursdays workshop allowed attendees to get a glimpse of the exhibits up close, he said.
Alleviating congestion on Highway 101 is a regional effort as the San Mateo County Transportation Authority allocated $108 million in local Measure A sales tax dollars last year to fund several projects.
It funded a Highway 101/Willow Interchange Project in Menlo Park for $56.4 million. It also chipped in $10.7 million for the Highway 101/Holly Street Interchange project in San Carlos.
Redwood City, which originally sought about $14 million for interchange improvements at Woodside Road, was given $2.65 million to help add vehicle lanes, sidewalks and bikeways, as well as expand and signalize the ramp intersection.
Belmont sought $7.8 million to fund its Ralston Avenue Corridor Complete Streets Improvement, an initiative that involved a multi-year study to enhance the citys main east to west thoroughfare for all modes of travel. However, the TA determined the project wasnt as competitive as the others that provided more countywide or regional benefits.
