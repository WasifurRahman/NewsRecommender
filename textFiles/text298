St. Michaels rebuild gets green light from PZC
St. Michaels rebuild gets green light from PZC

STONINGTON
The Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously approved the permitting necessary for leaders of the Church of St. Michael the Archangel to move forward with the demolition of the current structure and the construction of a new building.
In 2012, when the church voluntarily vacated the building because it was not structurally safe, church leadership and parishioners began debating the option of demolishing the current structure in order to build a new one or renovating the portions of the original church in dire need of attention.
From this section:
Stonington Board of Selectmen sets annual budget meeting
We thought we could just rebuild the roof structure and the steeple, but after looking more closely at the building, it became clear that the church walls also had to be upgraded because they were bowed, said Barbara Geddis of Geddis Architects. After seeing the risks involved doing such extensive renovations, we quickly realized that demolition and reconstruction was our only feasible option.
Because the earliest known photographs of the church are from 1910, the reconstruction plans will be based on the buildings appearance at that time.
These early photos are our touchstone for the current plan, she said. We want to be clear that this is not just a demolition but also a reconstruction. We will retain foundations and reconstruct the building that was there in 1910, all while using modern framing techniques.
The landmark building, located at 60-62 Liberty St., was constructed in 1861 at about half the size it is today, predating the towns zoning regulations by about 100 years.
According to Geddis, an addition was built within a decade of the original construction, bringing the church to its current 14,000-square-foot size.
Based on Geddis research, parts of the building such as the steeple, cupola and stained glass windows were modified, removed or replaced as architecture styles changed in the 1960s and 70s.
Systematically, various generations altered St. Michaels and yet it stood proudly on the hill, she said. Part of our long-range goal is to restore parts of it, such as the beautiful stained glass and the cupola, when there is money for that.
During the reconstruction, workers will be putting on a 745-square foot addition to allow for an elevator and ADA-compliant bathrooms, so the entire church building will be handicapped accessible.
According to Geddis, there will be no increase in seating capacity, parking or traffic around the facility. Neither Geddis nor Rev. Dennis Perkins offered a timeline for the work.
The bottom line is that once completed, the churchs intention is to assure that St. Michaels, in its 155th year, sees several more generations of parishioners in its lifetime, she said.
