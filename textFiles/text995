Chocolate is nice. A new set of glasses is thoughtful. Flowers are fine. Until they die.
But for this Mother's Day, to show mom how much you appreciate (almost) every little thing that she does, go beyond the nice, the fine, the acceptableand buy her gifts that are beautiful, unnecessary, even fun. No matter how much she loves you, she doesn't need another mug with your face screen-printed on it.
