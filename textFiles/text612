The Associated Press
LONDON
Commodities trading firm Liberty House has confirmed that it will bid for Tata Steel's available assets in the U.K., including the Port Talbot plant in south Wales.The company was among the first to express an interest in Tata, which announced plans to sell its U.K. businesses in March.India-based Tata says it is losing 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) a day at Port Talbot amid high costs and a glut of cheap Chinese steel in global markets.The government has said that it was prepared to take a 25-percent stake in any rescue of Tata, mindful of the 4,000 people who work at Port Talbot alone.Liberty said Tuesday that it has a strong "internal transaction steering committee and panel of leading external advisers to take the bid forward."Copyright The Associated PressTrending NewsReal-time primary updates: IndianaDont waste money on expensive gifts when these 5 DIY decorations will make Mom feel so specialFreebies, deals for educators abound on Teacher Appreciation DayMake your donations count today for 'Give Local America'7 things to know now: Indiana primary; Obama not offended by comedian; Jerry SanduskyHot topicsInside Journal News NewsSportsWeatherBusinessEntertainmentLifeFollow UsFacebookTwitterNewslettersRSS FeedsGeneral InformationContact Us: FeedbackAdvertisers & SponsorsCars at AutotraderLocal Services at KudzuCoupons at ValpakFind&Save Local ShoppingGeneral Acceptance PolicyMarketplaceJobsAutosClassifiedsReal EstateShoppingAdvertise 2016 Cox Media Group.
