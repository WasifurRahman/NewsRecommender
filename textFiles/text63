Bank of Marin reports strong earnings in first quarter of 2016.

Bank of Marin Bancorp, the parent company of Novato-based Bank of Marin, reported that earnings in the first quarter of 2016 increased to $5.6 million, compared to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2015.Russell Colombo, chief executive of Bank of Marin, said there were a couple of reasons for the jump in earnings.We had a really good fourth quarter in terms of loan growth, and we didnt get the benefit in the fourth quarter, because a lot of it came right at the end of the year, Colombo said. That was a big driver.
Bank of Marins net interest income totaled $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $16.6 million in the same quarter the previous year. Colombo said much of that interest income resulted due to the loan growth that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015.Colombo said another factor driving the growth in earnings was gains on credit impaired loans that were acquired in prior bank acquisitions.Bank of Marin reported $1.44 billion in loans at March 31, 2016, compared to $1.35 billion at March 31, 2015. The bank attracted $29 million in new loans in the first quarter of 2016, but they were offset by payoffs of approximately $37 million in existing loans.
Bank of Marins deposits totaled $1.68 billion at the end of first quarter of 2016, compared to $1.58 billion during the same period of 2015. Non-interest bearing deposits accounted for about 45 percent of the banks total deposits at the end of the first quarter.The bank reported $2.7 million in nonperforming loans at the end of first quarter of 2016, representing 0.18 percent of total loans, down from $9.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015. The bank made no provision for loan losses recorded in the first quarter of 2016 because the existing level of loan loss reserve did not warrant a provision.
The banks board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share on Friday.
