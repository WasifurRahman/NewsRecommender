Free integration released via Unreal Marketplace, lets studios track player behaviour
Danish firm GameAnalytics has forged a new partnership with Epic Games to bring its flagship product to Unreal Engine.
Unreal users are now able to integrate GameAnalytics into their game and used the backend tool to gain insights into how players are interacting with their game. The integration is available through Unreal Marketplace.
Devs will be able to break down behaviour into up to nine dashboards that can be customised to make it easier to understand their audience and other metrics.
GameAnalytics offers an awesome service to teams of all sizes, for every type of game you can imagine, said Epic Games Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney. Were happy to release GameAnalytics freely through the Marketplace, and our developers are going to love having even more vision into their games.
GameAnalytics founder Morten E Wulff added: Ever since we launched in 2012 our mission has been to provide the easiest yet most powerful free analytics tool on the market. Part of that vision has always included an Unreal SDK, so today is a big milestone for me personally, and Im proud of the work that the team put into making this a reality.
