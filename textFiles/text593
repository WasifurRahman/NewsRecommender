Anyone know the list & number of NPCs that'll pop out? Thanks!

Kuiper Galaxy Gate FAQ
There ya go
In my sig you see a link Game FAQ Index. Might want to book mark that one. Answers to many questions are there. All gates are listed there. I usually have the appropriate page open in the back ground so I can keep track of each wave as I do them

I was hoping an actual list (Wave 1: x amount of NPC, Wave 2: y amount of NPC) xD
But it's alright, I went in blind and finished it before the event was up cx
Mod(s) can close
