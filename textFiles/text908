Long road ahead for Mamatas Trinamool CongressIn spite of being unchallenged the party is wary of remaining in powerPublished: 16:09 May 3, 2016 Archisman Dinda, CorrespondentAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisKolkata: With elections for five out of six phases complete, and the fate of 269 of 294 assembly seats sealed, Kolkata is gripped by a wave of rumours, that Didis TMC (Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress) is losing power and the alliance between the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) and the Congress party is all set to form the next government.The wave gained momentum especially after the last two-phases of polling on April 25 and 30 where the state police suddenly regained its neutrality and was seen upholding the law and order ensuring a free and fair poll.Do you think police is acting tough on TMC without getting a scent of the ground realities, questioned a police officer. She [Mamata] has lost and the alliance will come to power, the officer said. Similar sentiments are being echoed by bureaucrats.The assembly poll this time is a three-cornered contest. The TMC is keen to prove that despite charges of corruption, scandalss and mis-governance, people are with them. The CPM-Congress combine is fighting for political survival, forcing the two to create an unprecedented alliance, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to prove that it has emerged as a major player in the local polity.Regardless of rumours, there is hardly any conceivable political challenger to Mamatas supremacy in the state. In the last five-years there has been a growing disenchantment, especially among the urban voters due to a lack of industrialisation, development, law and order and various scams that her party men got embroiled in. But none has emerged to challenge the TMC leader politically.She came into power on the promise of poriborton [change]. But the changes were cosmetic and what mostly changed was the net worth of her party men, Kingshuk Bose, a citizen, said.She has not fulfilled many of her promises, but that does not mean we want the CPM back into power. At least, under her there was some visible movement forward. The city is clean, well lit and roads are pothole free, said Tridib De.However, the rhetoric completely changes when one questions the rural voters. Her image has not been sullied by the scams and the flyover collapse. Villagers talk about the increased accessibility to their village due to road widening and construction of new roads. They refer to the Kanyashree programme that provides scholarships to girls after Grade 10. They talk about the Rs2 a kilo rice that the government gives.Roads and electricity situation is better than ever. Education avenues have increased. Many of the tribal and rural children have been encouraged and are first-generation students. said a 60-year-old villager of Birbhum district.Even if Mamata retains power, as many pollsters believe by a slender margin, her biggest challenge will be to cleanse the party, which is being controlled by strongmen and often corrupt individuals. Also the infighting within, where the TMC has at least three factions fighting for supremacy in every constituency, with ministers fighting live on camera will be another challenge for her. A strong opposition would mean many of these factions joining the coalition or, even worse, backstab the ruling party from within.Mamata has repeatedly been asking her party leaders to unite even bridging the year-long rift with her long time associate Mukul Roy
preventing him from creating a new party
and even publicly asking party leaders like Saugata Roy not to criticise the partys decision publicly.I am requesting leaders like Saugata Roy and other not to criticise the party publicly as its harms the party. This request is to one and all. Those who want to be with TMC for personal benefit are requested to leave, Mamata said while launching the TMC poll campaign in presence of all the leaders.However, she herself knows that the TMC is not out of danger and the biggest enemy lies within and her repeated admonishing may not be enough to sail through.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from India India: Forest guards held over rhino poaching5 minutes agoMuslims hold key for Mamatas return into power7 minutes agoIndia has jurisdiction in Italian marine case8 minutes agoLong road ahead for Mamatas Trinamool Congress19 minutes agoRebels, namesakes spoil candidates chances22 minutes agoIndia: Key candidates fighting West Bengal polls38 minutes agoForest fires can cause glacier melting, floods02:55 pmSocial media abuzz at Kanhaiyas stooping feat
