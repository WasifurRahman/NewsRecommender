The missing component in connectivity discussions: human rights
CONNECTIVITY: While connectivity is becoming a mainstream project beyond global internet policy discussions, Access Now notes that human rights are regrettably missing in the initiatives that strive to connect the next billion.
Although internet access is seen more and more a human rights issue, the current initiatives that promote connectivity such as the Global Connect Initiative do not sufficiently take into account rights, according to the article.
Access Now gives recommendations on how connectivity initiatives could promote human rights more strongly: First, the projects should include a Human Rights Impact Assessment that estimates and reassesses their impacts on rights; Second, programs that do not support Net Neutrality, including zero rating initiatives, should be discouraged; Third, its important to maintain connection, and that connectivity initiatives commit to pushing back against internet shutdowns, which have become regrettably common.
WAN-IFRAs Global Media Policy Forum will discuss Free Basics and zero rating initiatives, and their impact on news media, in 13 June in Cartagena, Colombia read more here
