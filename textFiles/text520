WORCESTER - Massachusetts Appeals Court judges are faced with a choice: Is Nicolas Guaman, the immigrant convicted in the 2011 dragging death of Milford resident Matthew Denice, a "stranger in a strange land," unable to comprehend what happened, or a drunk, reckless, and ultimately criminal driver?Those are the two arguments three appellate judges heard in Worcester on Monday morning. It will be at least a few weeks until the judges rule. If they favor the defense argument, it could lead to either a reduced sentence or a new trial. If they don't, Mr. Guaman's 12- to 14-year sentence for manslaughter stands.In 2014, Mr. Guaman, a native of Ecuador living illegally in the United States, was convicted of manslaughter and vehicular homicide after the August 2011 crash. After Mr. Gauman allegedly went through a stop sign, Mr. Guaman's truck and Mr. Denice's motorcycle collided at Fayette and Congress streets in Milford. Mr. Guaman kept driving and dragged Mr. Denice for nearly a quarter of a mile to his death.Mr. Gauman's attorney, Ethan Stiles, argued that either the manslaughter or the vehicular homicide charge should be dropped, because they are redundant. He argued that Mr. Guaman was negligent but not reckless; recklessness is needed to warrant a manslaughter charge.The two charges are essentially, we argue, the same, said Mr. Stiles, adding that the prosecution did not show enough evidence as to Mr. Guaman's recklessness. Mr. Guaman, he argued, simply didn't understand what was going on.Appellate Judge Gregory Massing prodded Mr. Stiles on the point. The judge said people were screaming, banging on the truck, and telling Mr. Guaman to stop.Isn't 'stop' and banging on the car a universal language? Mr. Massing asked.Mr. Stiles argued that Mr. Guaman's background
an Ecuadorian immigrant from an indigenous village in the Andes mountain range, where most people speak Quechua, not Spanish
means the screaming and banging may not have resonated with him as a call to stop.He is, essentially, a stranger in what would become a very strange land, said Mr. Stiles. The government had to prove the defendants awareness that the victim was actually being dragged.He argued that the district attorney's office did not sufficiently prove that.Judge Jeffery Kinder argued that Mr. Guaman's driving away from the scene showed an evasion of responsibility.Donna Marie Haran, assistant district attorney, argued that Mr. Guaman deserved every charge levied against him in the 2014 conviction. She argued that he was both negligent and reckless, and the two charges are both warranted.There was more than ample evidence provided for the judge to find the defendant guilty of manslaughter, said Ms. Haran.She pointed out that Mr. Denice's motorcycle went over the hood of Mr. Guaman's truck, in his line of vision. She said there is overwhelming evidence to suggest he was drunk.This defendant, instead of stopping and checking on the victim, after he saw the motorcycle go over the hood, then stopped for 1.5 seconds and began accelerating down the street, she said, adding that those actions demonstrate recklessness.If that were not enough, the defendant then dragged the victim for a quarter mile down the street.Mr. Haran used only half of the 15 minutes allotted to her for argument.The defense and prosecution focused mostly on Mr. Stiles' assertion that the manslaughter and vehicular homicide charges are redundant. Mr. Stiles maintained that the lack of an official translator used in the initial police interview means the trial judge should not have accepted it as evidence, and a 911 call placed by Mr. Guaman's niece allegedly saying he was out drinking and driving should not have been accepted as evidence either, because there were translation problems.Judges have up to four months to rule on the appeal.Outside the courtroom, Mr. Denice's mother, Maureen Maloney, spoke passionately against the appeal.I think this is totally bogus, she said.The appeal wastes taxpayer money and the trial proved that Mr. Guaman knew what he was doing when he dragged Mr. Denice, she said.He never showed a drop of remorse any time I saw him in court, she said of Mr. Guaman. The only remorse he feels is that he's in jail right now.Since her son's death, Ms. Maloney has become an outspoken critic on immigration issues. She argues that illegal aliens should not be on our roads and need to be held accountable to our laws.She lobbied outside the courtroom Monday for de-funding sanctuary cities (communities that shelter people living illegally in the United States) and lobbied for support of political candidates who put Americans first.She's active with the Remembrance Project, a group that advocates for families of people killed by immigrants living in the country illegally, and has met Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.She said she wants to see the government deport more people who entered the country illegally or who are here now without the proper paperwork.They're breaking our laws just by being here, she said.
