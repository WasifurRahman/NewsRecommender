Weird things near Chiang Mai. No 12 The Lake that isn't there

A must see for anybody visiting the north of Thailand is Doi Tao Lake. As can be seen from Google Maps it is a huge expanse of water, 4.2 kilometers across and four times as long. It is off the old road from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and is clearly sign-posted with one of those Blue Government tourist attraction signs. Take the turning and you will come to an ample car park surrounded by stalls for vendors to sell the fresh fish caught in the lake. This is the best viewing place for this unique lake. Its unique because there is no water in it, and there hasn't been any for more than two years. None at all, not a drop.As was going down to Phrae, I passed a lake that wasn't there.It wasn't there again today,I wonder why it went away
