Some answers to Mars water mysteryArticle By: Bulumko PapuTue, 03 May 2016 1:28 PM Share

Streaks spotted by NASA's Mars Reconaissance Orbiter. Credit: NASA/JPL/University of ArizonaA lab experiment conducted by researchers and documented by Nature Geoscience shows that liquid water on Mars is not just flowing but also boiling - solving one of the major mysteries about the surface of Mars.
After building a chamber replicating the conditions and atmosphere of Mars researchers put ice in it to melt. The ice did melt causing water to flow from it but also boiled as it flowed. This boiling effect was powerful enough to move surrounding dirt and debris.
The temperature was not the major contributing factor to the boiling of the water but the pressure of the atmosphere in the chamber.
Susan Conway, co-author of the paper that has the collated data, was reported by Gizmodo as saying: "The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low compared to that on the Earth, which means that water boils at a much lower temperature than it does on Earth."
"On the Martian surface the pressure is five to 10 millibars meaning that liquid water boils no matter what the temperature is."
This boiling water theory solves the issue of how Mars has carved out landscapes across its surface. The boiling water and the effects of it engrave lines on Mars clear enough for satellites to see them.
