Congress legislator T. Jeevan Reddy is known for making snatching remarks against CM KCR. The senior leader has once again launched a scathing attack on Chief Minister for neglecting the plight of farming community when the State was reeling under acute drought conditions.Speaking to scribes on Tuesday Jeevan Reddy has castigated Telangana CM KCR and said that KCR is responsible for draught conditions in North Telanagana districts. He has expressed concerns about the uneven designs of irrigation projects .Jeevan reddy alleged that KCR had succumbed to pressure from Maharashtra and reduced height of Tam-midihatti dam."Telangana state has slipped into Daridram( poverty) because of CM KCR. The State government is not declaring drought in all the districts of the State. There is no use with Kaleswaram project at Medigadda. TRS leaders have permanently mortgaged the interests of Telangana with Maharashtra government." Jeevan reddy Said
