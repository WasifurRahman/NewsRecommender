Blake Lively in Burberry at the Met Gala: stunning or poorly styled?
May 03, 2016

Blake Lively, Fashion, Karlie Kloss, Met Gala, Naomie Harris
Im still sort of shocked that out of all of the potential (British) models and actresses Christopher Bailey could have chosen, he ended up going with an American celebrity: Blake Lively.
Dont get me wrong, I understand that Bailey probably wanted to make a big statement and this Burberry gown is a big statement, even more so because he put it on someone known for being a Fashion Girl, like Blake.
While I love this dress
truly and completely love it
I dont think it has anything to do with the theme.
Its just a beautiful statement gown and it looks great on Blake.
My one qualm is that I think Blakes jewelry choices are not the best for the gown.
I feel like it should have been rubies or diamonds, not coral.
Also, she barely looks pregnant here, right?
Naomie Harris also got to wear Burberry.
I love Naomie, but this dress is a snooze.
I didnt expect to love Karlie Klosss Met Gala look, but here we are.
Karlie wore Brandon Maxwell and I thought she looked STUNNING.
My only disappointment was that she looked so much cooler with the coat/cape thing as she traveled to the Met Gala, and once she took it off to pose on the carpet, the look was not as special.

Did. Did Blake give birth? She doesnt even look a little bit pregnant, and she was very obviously showing a month or so ago. I hope its not anything awful :-/

Well there were rumors that she used a surrogate for her last pregnancy but who knows. This is why I dont like glorifying celebs bodies post pregnancy, we dont know the hows or whys.

Were there really rumors of surrogacy? Pretty silly if so. Not only did Blake have a legit-looking bump the last go round, her face changed, and she let her roots grow in to avoid hair dye.
Not to mention she has posted pics on IG about breastfeeding.

You can see a ittle bit of a belly in one pic. I think shes still only about 16-20 weeks along so while shes showimg, its still managable. She may be just wearing spanx to hide it, which is uncomfortable but doable. She didnt reveal with James until the third trimester and while she got outed this time, she may be trying to cover it up until she can do a spctacular belly-reveal.

She tends to hide her pregnancy really well. As for the dresstheme or not it looks absolutely stunning and Blake looks fantastic. She is wearing that dress is well. I guess maybe it was refreshing to see someone not drape themselves in tin foil. And I make that statement for everyone who looked great but didnt stick with the theme.

Blakes makeup is dreadful. I cant see her baby bump though. Did the dress hide it so well?
I still dont get the hype for Karlie Kloss. The smugness on her face drives me up the wall.

Whenever I see someone posting about a person looking smug, I cant help but think, Maybe its just her face? And yeah, that just looks like Karlies face to me.
Sometimes I think people use smug to justify a dislike for a person.

Blakes Burberry dress is fantastic. I love it. (Her hairstyle needs to be ashamed f itself and the earrings are way.too.much but that dress wow!) Also absolutely LOVE Naomies dress, I think it is gorgeous.
I think Karlies cape was beautiful. The dress though, not so much. Why are side cutouts a thing? I really, really hate them
I dont find them even remotely elegant, they interrupt a dress and distract from a persons face, its just ugh.

Naomie Harris is NEVER boring.
That stare of hers is everything.
I loved Karlies dress and coat.
If you look like that, you wear what she wore, LOL.

I always say that Karlie is one of the few models out of the new crop who has that striking factor that the supermodels had back in the 80s. Blake looks gorgeous but completely out of theme.

Well, haute couture is pretty much the definition of fashion a manus.manum? Mani? Blakes gown looks embroidered, and I actually love those earrings.
Maybe Anna Wintour would have better luck getting people to dress for the theme if she eschewed Latin words.

Loved her look, makeup is a bit harsh and hairstyle a bit too severe, but overall, she looks super sweet. I think its an illusion because of the fitted bodice aspect of her dress, but I think her bump is just concealed underneath.
Karlie s coat is DIVINE, and its a shame it was covering up that mess of cutouts. that dress would have been so much more chic if it hat the same silhouette but instead of the cutouts, have some sort of contrast paneling there, maybe with a different fabric, texture
I love Karlie, shes beautiful and smart. But the dress is a no-no.

What? I love Naomies dress. Blakes looks nice, but the hair and earrings are too much, but she seems to be a big fan of big chunky accessories. That cape is gorgeous. I want it.

The theme was not robots.
It was hand vs machine,
and how fashion changed due to sewing machines/technology.
So I think Blakes (hand?) embroidered dress actually works. Maybe in a sea of silver its easy to miss the point.

THIS! I think people thought if you werent dressed in aluminum or you didnt have some sort of technology thing you missed the theme. But yea I just looked up how Blakes dress was made and if you read the official theme description from the Met Gala she is actually on point with the theme.

Blakes makeup, hair and jewellry choices ruin it here. The dress is lovely, the more I look at it, but overall I am not loving it. Perhaps I would be more open on any other night, but the dress doesnt fit the theme at all.
Also, Karlies body is BANGING! I would DIE for her body.

I really like Blake lively but I am going to just say that this partially opened mouth, tongue between the teeth smile is bad. She is beautiful and has a nice smile when she really smiles. I hate the dress and the hair and the make up so much. But I still like Blake. A rare misstep for her.

I want to see the back of Karlies dress, and I cant find photos anywhere. I think she looks stunning.
Blake still looks pregnant to me. I like her dress, but her lipstick is harsh.
