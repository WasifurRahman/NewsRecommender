Sayles Werbner Founders Earn Dallas Legal Honors after Noteworthy Year
May 02, 2016, 12:29 ET
from Sayles Werbner
DALLAS, May 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --Accomplished attorneys Richard A. "Dick" Sayles and Mark S. Werbner of Sayles Werbner recently notched their eighth consecutive selections to D Magazine's prestigious list of the Best Lawyers in Dallas.
The Dallas honors cap a 12-month period in which the respected litigation boutique won two of the most important and precedent-setting cases in recent legal history.
Sayles Werbner helped hundreds of victims of overseas terrorist attacks reach a confidential settlement with Jordan-based Arab Bank last September. The settlement followed Werbner and co-counsel winning a jury verdict a year earlier in New York federal court where Arab Bank was found liable for providing material financial support to the Palestinian militant group Hamas for terrorist attacks in Israel and the Palestinian territories, the first such verdict in U.S. history against a foreign bank.
Sayles Werbner also prevailed for longtime client Commil USA LLC at the U.S. Supreme Court in one of the highest-profile patent infringement cases to reach the nation's top court in years. In 2011, the firm won a $74 million judgment for Commil against Cisco Systems Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment in a ruling that was heavily criticized for creating a new patent infringement defense that had no basis in law. The Supreme Court agreed by ruling in Commil's favor.
Firm attorneys Robert Sayles and Sawyer Neely recently were named to the annual Texas Rising Stars list of the state's top young lawyers after successfully defending a client in a multimillion-dollar Deceptive Trade Practices Act case last year.
Earlier this year, Robert Sayles and Shawn Long were promoted to shareholders at Sayles Werbner based on their successful track record for clients and firm leadership.
Other firm attorneys earning recent professional honors include William Snyder, Mark Strachan and Darren Nicholson, who were named to the most recent Texas Super Lawyers list based on their work in business litigation and intellectual property disputes. These three, along with Sayles and Werbner, have been recognized multiple times on the annual listing the state's best attorneys.
Read more about the firm's attorneys and their work here: http://www.swtriallaw.com/attorneys/.
D Magazine's annual listing of the city's top attorneys is based on nominations submitted by lawyers from throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth area, in addition to a review conducted by the publication's editors and a handpicked panel of local legal leaders. A complete listing of this year's honorees is available here: http://www.dmagazine.com.
Sayles Werbner maintains an international reputation as a proven trial law firm in complex business litigation, intellectual property matters, life-altering personal injury cases, product safety claims and practically every type of case that requires courtroom expertise.
