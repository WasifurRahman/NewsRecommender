Using latest drivers for Tesla K40 along with nvidia GT210

I just purchased a geforce 210 GPU for basic graphic acceleration on my server, which primarily uses Tesla K40 for number crunching. Now the problem which I have encountered deals with two different sets of nvidia drivers required to run each card. Geforce 210 is now supported in legacy branch, and thus the latest driver for it falls under 341.x series.
On the contrary, the Tesla is supported on current branch, i.e. 352.X. And I require CUDA toolkit v7.5, thus reverting back to 341.x branch for both cards is not an option.
My question is, is there a way to use the 210 without loosing access to latest driver release for Tesla ? There are some old unanswered question regarding same dilemma, but for older hardware.
