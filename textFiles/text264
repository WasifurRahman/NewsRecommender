Ecstatic fans rushed into thestreets of Leicester on Monday as the outsiders won thePremier League in a triumph seen as the most astonishing inthe history of English football.
Dancing crowds dressed in the teams blue jerseys huggedeach other and chanted songs honouring heroes such as managerClaudio Ranieri and striker Jamie Vardy, linchpins ofLeicester Citys first title triumph in its 132-year history.
There is only one Ranieri, chanted fans in celebrationof the Italian boss.
This year I got married and had a baby, but this tops itall, said Steve Robinson, 26.Its going to be a big and long party, because we havewaited a long time for this, added tourist guide Steve Bruce.
Thousands bearing blue and white flags celebrated besidethe King Power stadium and the cathedral where the skeleton ofRichard III was buried after it was discovered under a carparkin 2012
a fact seen by some to have brought the Midlandscity luck.
Fans circled the city centre blaring their car horns,while others warned that European giants such as Barcelonawere next in their sights as Leicester prepare to enter theChampions League for the first time.
Were coming for you, (Lionel) Messi! shouted ChrisWhiting, 20, in a reference to Barcelonas star Argentineforward.
At Hogarths pub nearby, fans had cheered on Chelsea toprevent second-placed Tottenham Hotspur getting the win theyneeded to prolong the title race until Saturday, at least.
After the 2-2 draw confirmed Leicester were champions,supporters jumped in elation and disbelief.Im going to party! Ive been supporting Leicester sinceI was 14 years old, can you imagine what this means for me?said Caroline Wilkins, 60, who added she watched the matchwith a friend because her husband hates football.
I feel on top of the world, I feel Im in heaven!Whiting said he had started to fear the title might slipthrough Leicesters fingers when Tottenham were two goals upin the first half of the game.
I still cant believe it I started worrying about thenext game, Whiting said.
This is a dream
Christine Norton, aged in her 60s, left the pub whenSpurs scored the second goal but returned when Chelsea managedto equalise.I told them: if I leave, theyll draw, Norton said.And here I am, I am really happy, this is a dream.
The city had been dyed blue in the build up, with one barselling cappuccinos decorated with Vardys face, a restaurantselling fried blue fish, and a supermarket even dying theirsausages blue.
Marc Wilks, who was selling T-shirts reading Champions2015-2016. Leicester Kings of England said the party wouldcontinue for some time to come.
Its been a fantastic day, very good for the business,Wilks said.
At the start of the season, few believed it was possiblefor a club representing a city of 330,000 people to beatLondons five Premier League teams and Manchesters two to thetitle.
Before the campaign started, bookmakers had offered5,000-1 against Leicester winning the championship.But fans got their payback for a lifetime of scorn andtaunts by Leicesters great local rivals, Nottingham Forest,who won the English league once and the European Cup twice inthe 1970s but now languish in the second-tier English Football
Championship.
Student Karishma Kapoor, 20, was laughing all the way tothe bank after betting 2 on Leicesterwinning at the start of the season
giving her a payout of10,000 ($14,650, 12,700 euros).We are a lot into football at home. So this summer wewere discussing the season ahead in my grandmas house and wedecided to bet one pound each with my auntie, Kapoor said.I would like to save some of it, go on holiday,hopefully and pay for my brother to go on a trip to aChampions League game.
