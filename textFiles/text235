Parramatta Eels penalty a watershed moment
The Parramatta Eels' penalty for salary cap rorting could be the best thing that's happened to the club, says Fairfax's Andrew Webster.

The Parramatta salary cap drama has finally been dealt with by the NRL. Pending Parramatta's rights to appeal the decision, we can all be satisfied that a thorough investigation has been conducted and the NRL is confident in justifying the penalties it has imposed.

I guess many people will have been staggered by the magnitude of the breaches that have been alleged by the NRL. This follows on from other major salary cap penalties imposed over the last decade on the Bulldogs, Warriors and Melbourne Storm.I asked a question at the time of the Melbourne Storm debacle in 2010, and I am asking the same question again now six years later
so what have we learned?Why did Parramatta do this? For that matter, why have any of the clubs that have been heavily penalised in this manner, commit the breaches they did?What Parramatta did is wrong and they will pay a heavy penalty for these breaches. But I honestly believe we need to look at the structure of our game and the nature of the environment that has been created, to see if there are measures we can take to ensure our game doesn't have to keep going through such sad circumstances.It's easy for people to say that the rules are in place, so it's black and white that you follow the rules or you pay the penalty. I know that all sounds very simple; and it would be perfectly fine if you believe that every other club was also following the rules. But for those people working in NRL clubs, whose responsibility it is to keep their team competitive in this premiership race against all other NRL clubs, the reality is that things are not so simple.The major problem is that the market for quality players is constantly overheated. The market forces which determine the price of footballers are inflationary. For as long as I can remember, these market forces have driven the price of all footballers and hence the cost of fielding a competitive team, well beyond the salary cap of the day. The market price for marquee players is determined by a false market, fuelled by third-party sponsorships, to levels well beyond the reach of most of the NRL clubs.There is a lack of trust amongst the clubs, rightly or wrongly, that other clubs are playing by the rules. The constant perception and rumours that tell us there are several NRL clubs spending anything from $1 million to even $3 million over the salary cap level each year thanks to private sponsorships. Whether these rumours or perceptions are true or not, whether these extra payments are actually legal or not, weighs heavily on the minds on those in charge of clubs who do not have access to such support.This is a results based business. No matter how hard they work, it's a reality that club board members, CEOs, coaches and staff are judged pretty much on the results of their football team. The pressure to win is inescapable. The temptation to push the boundaries in the pursuit of success, or sometimes even just to remain competitive, is immense.The intensity of this working environment is created by a number of factors. The lack of genuine investment in player development by a number of clubs, meaning that too many of our NRL clubs rely too heavily on recruitment to survive. Mind you, who can blame them for not investing in player development, when there exists little or no reward for development in our current salary cap system. Plus development of players takes a long time. Recruiting talented players from other clubs can speed up the journey to success.Our current competition pathways, which I have said on any number of occasions, are not conducive to producing an adequate supply of new talent each and every year into the NRL system.The lack of restriction and controls on player movement between NRL clubs for players of all ages, from rookies in the park, to the seasoned international performers, places all the power of negotiation with the player and player managers.The lack of transparency and knowledge on what rival clubs are REALLY spending on their NRL player rosters, means that rival clubs don't even know what they're chasing. They are chasing this imaginary or perceived target of what money you need to spend to be competitive.

The brutal truth about the NRL competition these days is the very real belief that if you want a football team that consistently wins matches and has the depth of talent to consistently challenge for finals football and even premiership titles, then you need to be spending more than the salary cap of the day. Run your eye over the top 25 playing rosters for the 16 NRL clubs and tell me in all honesty you think every club is spending the same amount of money.Not for one moment am I suggesting that clubs who do regularly spend more money than the salary cap are doing so illegally, because we know there are several clubs who have access to tremendous corporate support. These third-party sponsorships are legal and the players are entitled to earn as much as they can if the corporate world sees value in their brand. It's just that some clubs derive greater benefit from this corporate support than others. The game can't hide from this fact.I don't support what Parramatta has done, but by the same token, I don't think that the current whole of game structure itself is totally blameless either.What Parramatta has done is wrong. It's an obvious breach of the rules. If the magnitude of the reported illegal payments is correct, it's staggering to think that anyone at the club could ever believe they wouldn't be caught in the end. Many innocent people have been punished as a result. Whether or not today's Parramatta, the coaches, players and fans, should be punished so heavily for the actions of others in the past; well, this question will no doubt be debated for some time to come.But to ensure these circumstances are never repeated, I ask again; so what have we learned? Even more importantly, does our game have someone with the knowledge, the power and the courage to make the necessary changes, so it doesn't happen again?2. How were the Eels allowed to start the year so far over the cap? Prior to every season, every NRL club is supposedly subjected to an audit by the NRL to ensure they start the new season with a top 25 playing roster that is under the salary cap. The rules clearly state that you cannot start the season if your roster is not under the cap.

The NRL knew that Parramatta had breached its salary caps for the last three seasons. The Eels then went on an extraordinary buying spree in the off-season to secure the signatures of players such as Kieran Foran, Michael Jennings, Michael Gordon and Beau Scott.Yet the NRL didn't suspect, or at least their pre-season audit didn't reveal, that the Eels were almost $600,000 over the salary cap before a ball was kicked in season 2016? How are they allowed to start the season with their salary cap in that shape?3. Black cat strikes Kiwis againWhile New Zealand have beaten the Kangaroos in their last three Tests, their last win 12 months ago was their first mid-season victory this century.One reason for their lack of success in these mid-season clashes has been their inability to get their best players on the field for so many of these matches.Once againthe Kiwis have been hit hard with player unavailability. Their first choice five-eighth and key playmaker Kieran Foran is currently out of the game and, with injuries to both Tuimoala Lolohea and Thomas Leuluai, the New Zealanders will field their fourth choice five-eighth on Friday night.Star fullback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck will miss both this Test and the end-of-season Four Nations tournament, as will centre Dean Whare. Bans by the Warriors on Ben Matulino and Manu Vatuvei have been extended to include Test selection while back rowers Simon Mannering, Siosiua Taukeiaho and Iosia Soliola are out with injury.Prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves has just made a comeback after eight months on the sideline and was obviously not considered, while their No. 1 hooker, Issac Luke, is badly out of form and has been left out of the squad altogether.These are all significant outs. I still expect the Kiwis to be competitive on Friday, but without so many quality players you'd expect Australia, despite fielding the oldest Test side in Australian rugby league history, to be a little too strong.4. Now for the good news - well done HullWith all the disappointing news concerning the attitude of some clubs (and the game itself) towards a number of the representative fixtures this weekend, it was so refreshing to read the comments of Hull FC coach Lee Radford when he announced the release of two of his star forwards, Frank Pritchard and Siku Manu, for this weekend's Samoa/Tonga Test.Unlike in Australia, club football is not going on hiatus this weekend in Europe but that didn't stop Radford and his coach from recognising the significance of Test football to the code's health and long-term wellbeing.They also showed great respect for the honour Pritchard and Manu will experience in leading their respective nations on Saturday night."It's important for the growth of the international game that they're both turning out for Samoa and Tonga and great recognition for the club that we have two international captains in our ranks," Radford said.Pritchard and Manu will miss Hull's clash with St Helens on Sunday. Well done Lee Radford and Hull FC
hopefully your sentiments will resonate beyond Yorkshire.

5. Melbourne storm onAlthough the Melbourne Storm are one of only four teams yet to play against the Cowboys or Broncos, it's hard not to be impressed by the position they currently hold on the competition ladder.Seven wins from their first nine games means that for the 12th successive season the Storm have started the season with at least five wins from their first nine games. In 10 of those 12 seasons, it has been at least six wins from their first nine.Now that is a club that has prepared well in the off season!While their draw for the first nine rounds has been favourable, they have also had to overcome a number of obstacles. In particular, they have had access to their first choice back five on just one occasion.Champion fullback Billy Slater lasted one match and is set to sit out the remainder of the year. Centre Will Chambers, who played in all three Origin matches last year as well as the only Test match played by Australia in 2015, was ruled out for three months after fracturing his foot in round six.Wingers Young Tonumaipea and Marika Koroibete have both missed two of the Storm's last five matches. Even replacement back Richie Kennar was unable to play against the Titans last Sunday.Despite all this the Storm, with four of their best five outside backs missing, beat the Titans away from home 38-0. I just marvel at what Craig Bellamy has been able to do with this club over such a long period of time. While this Storm side is lacking the depth of talent they have been able to field in previous years, it is obvious they will continue to compete for 80 minutes in just about every game they play for some time to come. I have said it many times but Craig Bellamy is an extraordinary coach.

6. Pearce still the one for NSWThere are a couple of things I would like to say about the return of Mitchell Pearce for the Sydney Roosters last Saturday night.Firstly, it was great to see him back playing the game that he loves and performing so well in his comeback appearance. He is a quality player and the difference that he made the Sydney Roosters team was there for all to see.With Pearce leading the way I have no doubt that the Roosters will be highly competitive for the rest of the season and I expect them to make a huge charge towards a finals appearance.Secondly, and you can dress this up anyway you like, you can throw up any other names that you like, but Mitchell Pearce is still the No.1 option at halfback for the NSW Origin side.His critics, and there have been many over the years, seem to want to lay the blame for the Blues' poor Origin record over the past decade squarely at his feet. I find this criticism totally misplaced.To my mind, Mitchell Pearce has been a victim of the failings of the NSW team, he is not the cause. If I was Blues coach, this would be my first choice for the halfback role. I wouldn't be looking anywhere else.I suspect the vast majority of people will disagree with my opinion. That worries me little. In the meantime, I hope Mitchell Pearce continues to enjoy his football and respects his role as a professional footballer by keeping out of trouble. He can't afford another slip-up.
