Axl Rose and AC/DC Rehearse Hells Bells and Back in Black

AC/DC and Axl Rose have been rehearsing in Lisbon ahead of their debut gig there on May 7. Earlier this week, fans uploaded two brief videos on which the group can be heard rehearsing Thunderstruck and Shoot to Thrill.
Now new and longer videos have emerged on which the group can be heard practicing Hells Bells, Hell Aint a Bad Place to Be and Back in Black. The audio is pretty lousy, and people are frequently heard talking over the music, but until May 7, this is probably as close as the general public is going to get to hearing AC/DC fronted by Axl Rose.
