HIGHER EDUCATION BUBBLE UPDATE: University admits paying $17,570 for a dining hall table was a mista
May 3, 2016
TO ASK THE QUESTION IS TO ANSWER IT: Why Arent We Having a National Conversation About Leftist Violence?, David Harsanyi asks at the Federalist:
The media was happy to portray the peaceful Tea Party as a movement surreptitiously driven by racism without a shred of proof outside its opposition to Barack Obama. You will remember Paul Krugman blamingpeaceful assembly and free speechfor an insane persons assassination attempt against Kathleen Gifford, and Ezra Klein lamentinghow scarythings get when conservatives oppose liberal doctrine. Every shooting in America necessitates a thorough investigation into political proclivities of the perpetrator. Is he angry at the president? Did he ever register as a Republican? Is he fond of the Confederate flag? But only when the facts mesh with the helpful narrative do we hear about it.
At the American Conservative, Rod Dreher adds, Whats the matter with California? I was shocked last week to see the Latino mob riot outside a Donald Trump rally in Orange County, destroying a police car:
[S]eeing what happened last week at the two Trump events in California makes me wonder if theres something particularly extreme about the states political culture. I am far from a fan of Donald Trump, and I fully support the right to protest him. But riots and violent protests? Imagine if white Trump supporters rioted in an attempt to shut down a Hillary Clinton rally, and tore down police barricades in an attempt to get into a hotel where she was speaking, to shut down her speech? The news media would be in crisis mode, and I wouldnt blame them, actually: a country in which a candidate running for president has to fear for his and his supporters safety at a political rally is a country that is in trouble.
But hey, no big deal as far as our media are concerned. Just like the radically illiberal culture on many American campuses, where SJWs no-platform speakers they dont like all the time, has not bothered the media overmuch. Theydont seem to mind mobs and thugs running roughshod over basic civil liberties, as long as those mobs and thugs are on the political and cultural left.
While the future is always uncertain, in his latest column at Townhall,Kurt Schlichter is back from a trip in the TARDIS to 2017 to explore one way the disparity between the DNC-MSMs efforts at whitewashing their own and the vastly different optics the public witnessed could play themselves out in the coming months.
Hint: Its titled, Looking Back On How Donald Trump Beat Hillary Clinton.

Most people just want to live in peace and be left alone. The left makes that impossible.

All this wishful thinking about Clinton not becoming our next president is tedious.The payments have been made. There are promises to keep.Five industries - IT, finance/banking, education, entertainment, and public employment - have spent almost a billion dollars already in various ways to elect her in return for favors. They aren't going to walk away from that investment.Unless she dies before January, she will be the next president. The legal landscape her SCOTUS appointments will create will start a civil war. God help us all.

If the venue had been Europe and the rioters had been Muslim, we would have clucked to condemn the Euros for not doing a good job of assimilating, rightly so IMO, because the riots would have been at least in the "Muslim" enclave. Does the California crap remind anyone of the wonderful job we are doing of assimilation. Yes we are, because the illegals feel right at home to come out of their enclaves and behave like animals in all enclaves. Bravo for the assimilation.

I'm not all that big a Trump fan, but I've been saying for months, that he's going to destroy Hillary in ways most people cannot imagine. Schlichter has imagined a few.Pass the popcorn!

"Kathleen Gifford"? I think Mr. Harsanyi meant to say "Gabrielle Giffords."

The government unions are allied with the Democrats.
They're required to be on the scene, but they don't have to arrest the democrat rioters, or protect anybody who might be a Republican.
They know where their pensions come from, and selective enforcement is a tool.#LookForTheUnionLabel.

All we need is a media savvy politician able to exploit the contradictions. Shame on the Republicans for decades of ignoring this issue. While I would rather the Tea Party have brought them down, it's sufficiently important that they be brought down that I will live with Donald Trump as their destroyer.

It's that soft bigotry of low expectations that feeds the monster called the left (aka Democrats et. al.) The poor underprivileged, downtrodden victims of Evil Western Civilization cannot be expected to follow the law or behave civilly.Can they?
