A year after launching a solo country career, the Aerosmith frontmanis hitting the road this summerwith a new band (the Nashville-based Loving Mary) and a different approach to playing live. On his 19-city Out on a Limb tour, kicking off July 2 in Las Vegas, the rock icon is trading arenas for more intimate concert venues, where he'll rework Aerosmith classics and tell stories behind some of the band's most beloved hits.The idea stemsfrom an acoustic performance he didlast fallas part of PBS' Front and Center series, with an emphasis squarely on the fans."What would I not pay to go see (Paul) McCartney, but instead of playing with whoever he's with now, actually do (a show)where he tells you what he was thinking when he wrote Yesterday?" says Tyler, 68. "That's what I'm doing. I figured I'd talk about Sweet Emotion andDream On and where I was when I wrote it,and Seasons of Witherand how I played it."Fans got a sneakpreview of Out on a Limb in New York Monday, where Tyler hosted a benefit show at Lincoln Center's David Geffen Hall for Janie's Fund. Created by the singer in partnership with Youth Villages, the initiative offers financial support to young women and girls who have been abused or neglected. It's a cause that's been important to Tyler since writing Aerosmith's stirringJanie's Got a Gun, about a girl who takes revenge on her incestuousfather."When I wrote the lyrics to Janie's Got a Gun, I didn't really know who or what it was it was just a phrase off the top of my head that worked in the particular piano riff I was writing," Tyler says. "But soon after, I found out about how many girls get abused in America and around the world." With his charity, which launched inNovember, "it was a way to lend my voice to girls that have no voice."Since touring with Aerosmith last summer, Tyler has played a handful of one-off concerts and festivals, and recently bought a home in Nashville. So far, he has released two singles as a country artist (Love is Your Name and Red, White and You), and is currently finishing up astill-untitled album with renowned producer T Bone Burnett."It's a full-on country feel," Tyler says. "People ask me, 'Why'd you go country?' It was almost a shoo-in. I always wanted to do Everly Brothers." Playing onstage with the six-pieceLoving Mary, "it really is beautiful getting out there and singing with a band, where I can look at all the guys and go, 'Stop playing right now' and we'll just sing a cappella. I've never been in a band like that, so it's a whole new thing for me."Although the projecthasn't been embraced by everyone (including his Aerosmith bandmate Joe Perry), Tyler says the change of course is just what he needed right now."Look, I don'texpect to hit like The Beatles or be the second coming of Aerosmith," Tyler says. After four decades with the band, "it was time for a little break. I'msuch a passionate person that if I don'tgo after my muse like that, I'llwind up on drugs again. I'llwind up arguing with people and just no good."Tickets to Steven Tyler's Out on a Limb tour go on sale May 14 on livenation.com.The full list of dates:JULY2 Las Vegas, Venetian Theatre5 Los Angeles, Dolby Theatre8 Seattle, Marion Oliver McCaw Hall10 Vancouver, Orpheum Theatre14 San Francisco, The Masonic20 Phoenix, Comerica Theatre23 Denver, Ellie Caulkins Opera House26 Austin, Bass Concert Hall29 Houston, Brown Theater at Wortham CenterAUGUST1 Dallas, Music Hall at Fair Park13 Chicago, Chicago Theatre17 Nashville, Andrew Jackson Hall at TPAC23 Washington, D.C., Warner Theatre29 Clearwater, Fla., Ruth Eckerd HallSEPTEMBER1 Atlanta, Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center4 Boston, Citi Performing Arts Center Wang Theatre7 Philadelphia, Academy of Music10 Providence, R.I., Providence Performing Arts Center13 Toronto, Sony Centre for the Performing Arts
