Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 9 By Stefan LindequeAdded 12:49 | May 3, 2016 TweetPrintEmailShare Source:Supplied Overall, this is a surprising little car thats fun to driveAs a Volkswagen Golf driver and enthusiastic supporter of German engineering, I thought the Mazda 2 would struggle to make a positive impression on me. But I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised. Sure, the engine wont win any high-performance awards, but nonetheless the car seems pretty well thought out and put together.The drive is smooth, and both road and wind noise appear to be well controlled. Electronic gadgetry around the cabin is also comparable to vehicles that are way pricier than this little nipper. But if I had to complain about a few things, they would be the lack of armrest or elbow support between the front seats, and the drivers footwell seems rather narrow, although surprisingly the foot controls dont feel too cramped at all.Oh, and as a photographer lugging lots of equipment around, I found boot space to be inadequate. But overall, this is a surprising little car thats fun to drive.TweetPrintEmailShare More Long-term reviewsLong-term review: Mercedes-Benz GLC - Week 3Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 9Long-term review: Mercedes-Benz GLC - Week 2Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 8Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 7Long-term review: Mercedes-Benz GLC - Week 1Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 6Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 5Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 4Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 3Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 2Long-term review: Mazda 2 - Week 1Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 12Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 14Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 13Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 11Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 10Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 12Long-term review: 2016 Volvo V40 T5 - Week 9Long-term review: 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser - Week 11
