Bluffdale homes flood after canal overflows

Three Bluffdale homes were flooded Monday with water from a nearby canal after it was clogged.
One home, located near Gun Stock Drive and 15700 South in Bluffdale, accumulated four feet of water in its basement.
Residents started filling the canal, used for secondary water, earlier in the evening, but loose sage brush prevented normal flow.
The homes' residents were evacuated, and crews from the Bluffdale fire department helped sandbag the area.
