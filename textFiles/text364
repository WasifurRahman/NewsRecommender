Karolina Kurkovas Marchesa Met Gala gown lit up in response to Tweets: still fug?

Karolina Kurkova was one of the ladies in Marchesa last night at the Met Gala. She was in this dusty blue tulle and white floral applique gown with little twinkle lights sewn into it which changed color based on the emotions of people responding on her social media accounts. It was unclear how this worked exactly. They were vague about it on E! when they covered her getting ready and when she tried to explain it in a video it made no sense. She couldnt sit down because of the lights, and IBM worked on the technology. CNET has a description of how the dress works and it sounds like the plot to Inside Out. There are five key emotions it will search for on social media: joy, passion, excitement, encouragement and curiosity. When it detects these emotions, the dress glows in real-time. Its a very twee gown, regardless. At least it was in keeping with the theme. I would have liked to see more gowns last night with actual technology features. Why did no one have some kind of led display built into their gown? At least hire some tech people to rig something up with raspberry pi.
En route! Please comment on all of my social media accounts b/c my dress will react to your emotions! #cognitivedress #emotionalintelligence #wearabletech #MetGala #MetGala2016 @georginachapmanmarchesa @marchesafashion @ibm

Poppy DeLevigne was also in Marchesa, in a kind of 1920s showgirl elaborately tiered gunmetal gown. I dont get a retro futurist vibe from this, its just retro. At least this looks like a costume. These are the kind of crazy intricate gowns we want to see at the Met Gala. Also, her styling is perfect. I wouldnt think that long straight hair would go with that dress but it does.

Nina Dobrev was in a gold cap sleeve tulle and sequin Marchesa that would have looked more at home on Kate Beckinsale. This is just a fussy dress that has little to do with the theme. At least it fits her like a glove and you can see the incredible detail that went into it, but I would have liked to see her in something more daring.
Lordes tiered tulle and v-neck spaghetti strap Marchesa is sagging on her. It looks like a fun gown, but more along the lines of something a kid would wear to dress up. I think thats because the top is hanging so loose and the skirt is huge. Plus she has that cutesy hunched stance. No one seems to know how Lorde broke her arm.

I didnt watch the video to see the explanation, but there is a thing called sentiment analysis. It analyses language in interwebz postings with the keywords/accounts of your choice, and grades along the lines of positive, negative, neutral. Businesses use it to judge the success of ad campaigns or product launches. There are plenty of Twitter apps that will do this for you. So presumably that?

If all these people put all these energies in something productive they would change the world.
A dress that changes color on tweets. How dumb is that.

I am SO excited about Karolinas dressIBM took the lead on it, and reached out to Marchesa to create it. The IBM team used analytics to design the dress itself based on previous Marchesa designs, then outfitted it with LCD lights that change color according to real-time feedback on social media. The colors were assigned emotions that were being expressed in the social media posts.
The problem isa dress that lights up based on social media needs to be seen in real time, and Anna Wintour banned it from the Met Gala.
So I cant find a video of the dress actually changing color.

Claire Daness dres lit up! Was that LED? Because that was rad. This one just seems tacky.
Looooove Nina and Poppys gowns, though. Cant believe I just complimented Marchesa!
Lorde, I love you girl, but what are you slouching like that for. The Met Gala is for modelling. E tu, please.

I love Ninas dress. Just love it. And Karolinas dress looks fabulous and ethereal and I wish we could see more pics of it changing colour. Now thats on theme!
Poppy looks like she is wearing the love child a Michaels rhinestone bag had with the chain link department at
Home Depot. Yikes.
Lorde, why dont you stay home? The dress is horrible, the posture is worse, the scowl suggests that you;d rather have a tooth extraction without anesthetic than be there. (the bracelet was glorious though
a lot of pretty jewels out last night).

I like Karolinas dress lights and all. Lorde looks miserable but her shorter hair and tamer curls look great.
As an aside, the recent addition of pop up ads on every photo are really annoying.

She looked like a ghoul. Bad posture, sour face, everything. No she doesnt have to smile, but she looks like shes supposed to be haunting some abandoned school gym somewhere.
