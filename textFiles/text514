Contract business leaders highly sought after in London
Posted inNews archiveon03 May 2016
Demand for contract and interim senior level positions in London is at a record high, according to new research from Sonovate, the leading recruitment finance provider.Company ProfileSonovateView profile The data, taken from vacancies advertised on 180 job boards and half a million employer websites, indicate that postings for these roles increased at a rate of 23 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Director-level vacancies saw 39 percent QoQ growth
with over 1,100 advertised roles in Q1 2016.
Richard Prime, co-CEO of Sonovate, comments: Nobody needs to be told that London is a hotbed of British business, but the increase in advertisements for senior roles indicates that theres a huge appetite for quality leadership in the capital.
He adds: Of course, because these advertisements are for contract positions, the research also suggests that quality leadership isnt necessarily about the long-term anymore. More and more companies are onboarding senior staff to shepherd projects towards completion
or just to have a steady hand on the tiller in the midst of a storm.
Londons top three highest-paid contractor roles in Q1 2016 were Head of Programme Management (850 per day), Strategy Director (750 per day), and Senior Change Manager (737 per day). At the lower end of the scale, Programme Director positions were advertised at a rate of 616.
Prime comments further: That these roles are being advertised in high volume is interesting; that theyre being advertised at such competitive rates suggests that London enterprise is in fine shape. Companies want great contractors and great leaders
and theyre willing to pay very good money for them.
Londons level of growth in this area is predicted to continue
and perhaps at an ever faster pace. The future looks bright for senior appointments contractors: combined management and director level vacancies are expected to increase 16 percent by July 2016 to 6,300 roles.
