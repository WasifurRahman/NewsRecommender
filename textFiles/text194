Pressure mounts on European Commission to regulate cryptocurrencies.
BLOCKCHAINS: The European Commissions economy committee has called on the Commission to examine the regulation of virtual currencies, noting that the new technologies could represent notable advantages for ordinary citizen, Ars Technica reports.
Although bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, has received bad press for supposedly facilitating criminal activity, many are advocating for a more widespread use of blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin.
Blockchain essentially is a decentralised ledger, which according to its proponents has great potential in increasing transparency and traceability of transactions.
While MEPs are calling on European-wide regulations, the UK government is already looking at how to use virtual currencies to distribute public money more efficiently.
