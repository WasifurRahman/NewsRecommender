INDIANAPOLIS
The Latest on Tuesday's Indiana primary election (all times local):7:52 a.m.Some central Indiana polling stations are seeing steady crowds as voters cast their ballots in the state's primary election.Lines had formed outside some Indianapolis polling stations before those sites opened their doors Tuesday. But the deputy director of Marion County's clerk's office, Russell Hollis, says it's too early to say whether turnout out is heavier than normal for the primary.About two dozen people were lined up outside the Broad Ripple Park Family Center on Indianapolis' north side before its polling station opened.Polling site inspector William Rawls says 140 people voted there in just over the first hour, which he calls very strong for a primary.In Hancock County, just east of Indianapolis, some polling stations were facing periodic technical problems, but all county polling sites were open.7:03 a.m.Polling stations have opened across Indiana for the state's closely-watched primary election after the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates spent days campaigning in the state.Polling sites opened to voters at 6 a.m. EDT Tuesday in 80 of Indiana's 92 counties. Voting sites opened an hour later in 12 counties in northwestern and southwestern Indiana that are on Central Daylight Time. All Indiana polling sites will close at 6 p.m. local time.Elaine Clark, a 57-year-old stress management trainer, was among Tuesday's early voters at Allisonville Christian Church's polling station in Indianapolis.Clark voted for Donald Trump in Indiana's Republican presidential primary. Clark says she likes Trump because of his business success and because he's not a politician. She says, "I'm excited to try a non-politician for once."1:42 a.m.The nation's attention turns to an Indiana primary election that could play a significant role in who wins the Republican and Democratic presidential nominations.Voters on Tuesday also will decide the GOP nominee for an open U.S. Senate seat. Other races include GOP primaries for two open U.S. House districts, and two challenges to Republican leaders in the state Senate.Turnout already has set records. The Indiana Election Division said that more than 270,000 people cast early ballots. That's nearly 50 percent more than the state's previous record for early voting in 2008.Election Division Co-Director Angie Nussmeyer says she doesn't know whether the jump in early voting will mean higher turnout overall. In other states, the presidential primaries have driven more voters to the polls.
