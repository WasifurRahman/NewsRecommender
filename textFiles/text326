BEIRUT (AP) -- The Latest on Syria's civil war and the escalating violence in the contested northern city of Aleppo (all times local):
1:45 p.m.
The U.N. envoy for Syria and Russia's foreign minister have begun talks in Moscow about reviving the stalled cease-fire in Syria. Staffan de Mistura is also expected to push for the truce to include the contested city of Aleppo, which has seen an escalation in violence in recent weeks.
De Mistura's meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday comes a day after he met with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Geneva.
In opening remarks, da Mistura said that "we need to make sure the cessation of hostilities is brought back on track."
In Syria on Tuesday, Syrian rebels and government forces were shelling each other's neighborhoods in Aleppo, leaving several dead and scores wounded on both sides.

Syrian state TV says dozens of people have been killed or wounded when rebels fired rockets into a government-held neighborhood of the northern city of Aleppo.
The TV says one of the rockets fired on Tuesday hit the Dubeet hospital in the central neighborhood of Muhafaza. The TV did not give a breakdown of the casualties.
A doctor at another Aleppo clinic, the Al-Razzi hospital, says four people were killed and more than 30 were wounded when the rocket hit Dubeet.
The doctor says rebel bombardment of government-held parts of Aleppo on Tuesday killed a total of 12 people and wounded more than 70. The physician spoke on condition of anonymity for fear for his own safety.
More than 250 civilians have been killed in the past two weeks in Aleppo.

11:00 a.m.
Syrian state media say new rebel shelling of government-held parts of the northern city of Aleppo has killed at least seven people and wounded 35.
Syrian TV says the shells hit several neighborhoods during morning rush hour in contested Aleppo, which has been the center of violence in recent weeks.
Tuesday's attack comes as diplomatic focus moves to Moscow where the U.N. envoy for Syria is arriving for talks on restoring a piecemeal cease-fire that would also include Aleppo, Syria's largest city and once commercial center.
The activist Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed the shelling, saying there are casualties.
The Observatory says more than 250 civilians have been killed in 12 days of violence in both government- and rebel-held parts of the city.
