New Music Of The Day: Man Of Moon - Medicine EP
By Matt Wilkinson
3rd May 2016
Home &sol; Blogs &sol; Blog Article
Two 20-year-olds from Edinburgh, Man Of Moon would probably be a fair bit bigger if they were based in London.
Perhaps that's a catch 22 for them though. They seem a lot less restricted than other new UK bands, and their forthcoming Medicine EP is an eclectic affair. On lead track 'I Run' they dip into Krautrock territory, while singer Chris Bainbridge's vocals recall the doomier side of 80s Brit indie (Echo & The Bunnymen, The Jesus And Mary Chain). There's a bit of Tame Impala's sonic palette thrown in too, and final song 'Voices' is a slow-building drone that wouldn't sound out of place on a Levitation Festival playlist.
The Medicine EP is out digitally this Friday, via Melodic, having been produced by Frightened Rabbit man Andy Monaghan. Stream the full thing below:
