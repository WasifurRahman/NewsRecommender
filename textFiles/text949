Four days after the rioting Donald Trump opened up a 34 point lead in the Golden State leading Ted Cruz 54-20%.
KSDKreported:Donald Trump is leading Ted Cruz by a whopping 34 percentage points
54%-20%
among likely Republican voters in California, a SurveyUSA poll for KUSA found.Thats a significant gain for the Republican frontrunner, whose lead was only 8 percentage points in the last SurveyUSA poll a month ago. And its a significant loss for Cruz. The two were 40%-32% last month.California, which holds its primary June 7, is the most delegate-rich state on the Republican primary calendar with 172 at stake for GOP hopefuls.That makes Indiana, which will award 57 delegates after its primary Tuesday, all that much more important for Cruz if he wants to stop Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination. In the most recent poll, though, he is trailing by 15 percentage points in the Hoosier State.
