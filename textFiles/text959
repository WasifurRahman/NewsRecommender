Cardozo declines school committee seat
Cardozo declines school committee seat
Robert Cardozo

RICHMOND
Former Chariho School Committee member Robert Cardozo will not accept the committee seat vacated by Kevin McGreevy. The town will now have to advertise for a resident to take McGreevys place. Richmond has three members on the school committee.
McGreevy is leaving Rhode Island to take a job in New Hampshire. The Richmond town charter stipulates that the open school committee seat must be offered to the person who received the second-highest number of votes in the previous election, so the Town Council was obliged to offer McGreevys seat to Cardozo.
Bob Cardozo was the only other candidate on the ballot, and hes declined, said Richmond Town Clerk Tracy Nelson. Now the council can move on to advertising and appointing any qualified voter of the town.
Cardozo, 68, served on the school committee for nearly four years. He said his decision not to return had been a difficult one.
It was agonizing from the standpoint that I enjoy giving back to my community. I enjoyed the part of being on a committee that was responsible not only for education but also for the budgetary process and I thought that was critical. Now I see that theres 11 other people that are doing it, and I can step back and say I did what I wanted to do. I hope I made a difference. I think I did. I got a great deal of satisfaction from it, but its time for somebody else.
An experienced teacher, Cardozo now works several days a week as a substitute teacher in the Chariho district.
While he has no desire to return to the committee, he does have an interest in running for town council.
Theres other things that I would like to do, he said. I enjoy teaching and I enjoy being in the schools themselves with the kids, and I could not do that if I was on the school committeeOne thing I would like to do is possibly run for town council. I think thats the next things that I would look at.
The council will immediately begin the search for McGreevys replacement.
