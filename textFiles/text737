Unsightly masts in ODZ area of high landscape value to be
Unsightly masts in ODZ area of high landscape value to be pulled down
Tuesday, 3 May 2016, 14:14
Last update: about 20 minutes ago
Twenty dilapidated masts which date back to the British period and once formed part of the Wied Rini Maritime Coastal Station, limits of Bahrija will be dismantled following planning permission by the Planning Authority.
These unsightly structures, with a high visual impact and spread over a vast area of approximately 55,000m are today obsolete and pose a danger to the public visiting the area.
The entire site area falls within an Area of Agricultural and High Landscape Value and is mostly scheduled as an Area of Ecological Importance (Levels 3 and 4). A number of curt ruts lie in close proximity to some of the masts.
The removal of these masts is sure to improve the landscape quality of the area.
