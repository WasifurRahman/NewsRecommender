AireSpring Honored with 2016 Visionary Spotlight Award
May 03, 2016 --
Las Vegas, NV (PRWEB) May 03, 2016
AireSpring, a provider of cloud communications and managed connectivity solutions, announced today at Interop 2016 (@Interop) that it has been honored with ChannelVision's Visionary Spotlight Award in the category of ?UC & VoIP
Best Channel Deployment" for their AirePBX Cloud Business Phone System. The annual Visionary Spotlight Awards recognize excellence in outstanding products, services and deployments across a broad range of communications technology categories, including voice, data networking, hosting, cloud services and managed services. The winners of the 2016 Visionary Spotlight Awards showcase the best of the communications industry's overall innovation efforts, highlighting future-thinking execution and creativity. AireSpring's AirePBX is a fully-featured, enterprise-grade cloud phone system that provides true unified communications capabilities that was recognized for its unique, one of a kind delivery, installation, and service model. AireSpring offers the ultimate in fully-managed and supported business VoIP solutions that exceeds other vendors' "best-effort internet" service and delivery model.
AireSpring provides:
Onsite delivery, installation and testing of Cisco switches, Adtran routers and IP phones by qualified technicians
A fully managed circuit over AireSpring's nationwide advanced IP Network with end-to-end QoS
Personalized service with a dedicated project coordinator both pre and post turn up
Free IP phones with contract AirePBX is unique because AireSpring fully manages the entire circuit, from the customer's VLAN to their WAN network. Unlike service provided over the unmanaged public Internet, AireSpring's fully managed, nationwide network retains full control over inbound and outbound voice and data. Owning and operating the network helps ensure users receive consistent voice quality and true end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS). AireSpring not only revolutionized the technical delivery of the service, but fundamentally changed the customer care model for a cloud hosted PBX. AireSpring's true "white glove service" is further complemented by full technical support and AireCare, an advanced online portal to administer and manage customer accounts. In the unlikely event that an issue still arises that cannot be resolved with AireSpring's dedicated project coordinator or customer service team, every customer receives an escalation list that includes all the names and phone numbers of key operations team members and even includes the CEO's phone number.
?AireSpring is honored to add this prestigious industry award to our accolades. Our focus remains on providing our Channel Partners with the highest quality service and solutions at competitive prices and being distinguished for our execution in the fulfillment of that promise is especially rewarding," stated Daniel Lonstein, AireSpring's COO. The winners of the 2016 Visionary Spotlight Awards showcase the best of the communications industry's overall innovation efforts, highlighting future-thinking execution and creativity.
?We congratulate and thank AireSpring for its outstanding achievement in innovation in the communications industry, and for its dedication to channel partners and the indirect ecosystem," said Berge Kaprelian, group publisher at Beka Business Media. ?We have created the Visionary Spotlight Awards program to highlight the rapid pace of evolution within the communications industry, and to give innovators and industry visionaries the opportunity to gain the exposure and recognition that they deserve.
