Other artists are yet to be announced, but there will be concerts on November 24 and 26.It has been challenging [to get Rihanna]... we have been working to secure her for over a year almost to make sure that we secure the artist early in time for the announcement ... Rihanna was doing her world tour so we discussed it with her artist manager, their routing, days and where they were going. We managed to negotiate how to put Abu Dhabi Formula 1 into that, said Reeva Bains, vice president, Marketing & Communications at concert organisers Flash Entertainment.The good news doesnt end there. While it remains to be seen if Rihanna will bring her risque outfits to the UAE, her material for the show will not be altered.When tabloid! asked Bains if the show would be tailored keeping in mind the cultural sensibilities of this region, she said: Generally no. Shows arent censored. We always provide guidelines, and the artists are always culturally sensitive. However, the material will be as per the global tours.The inclusion of the long-enduring band the Chemical Brothers, who released their album Born In The Echoes last year, was an attempt at attracting all kinds of audiences

This year we have a 30 per cent discount to all those who buy tickets before 31st of May, said Nick McElwee, Sales & Marketing director for Yas Marina Circuit.We also have the artists early because we want to make it clear about what to expect ... The momentum is building for the racing weekend.Several incentives are also being added this year to boost sales.Initiatives such as Formula One ticket holders getting access to Ferrari World and Yas Waterworld, said Karim Al Guanaini, senior vice president of destination management at Yas Island.The artist that will perform on Thursday, November 24, is still under discussion. The night is usually reserved for Arabic acts, however changes should be expected this year.We are working on some changes and Thursday concert is under discussion.
