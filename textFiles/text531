YEAH, HER RECORDS AWFUL, WHICH IS WHY SHES RUNNING ON HER VAGINA:
Trump rips Clintons bad judgment.
Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clintons judgment on Monday, foreshadowing an attack line that he could use in a general election showdown.
Trump argued that while suggesting Clinton isnt qualified to be president is a big stretch, its fair to say the former secretary of State suffers from bad judgment.
Emails, bad judgment. Iraq, voted yes, bad judgment. Libya, bad judgment. All bad judgment, the GOP presidential front-runner said during a rally in Carmel, Ind., on the eve of the states primaries.
The attack is drawn from criticism offered by Clintons Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, who has criticized Clintons judgment and argued the former secretary of State was not qualified to be president. Sanders eventually backtracked on the latter remarks.
Trump signaled last week that he would be using Sanderss attack lines on Clinton, saying during a television interview, When he said bad judgment I said, sound bite!
He said she suffers from bad judgment, Trump said Monday, referring to Sanders. Its true.
Yes, it is.

This is how it starts.Clinton can barely hold off Sanders and right now she is trying to get the Liberal vote.What happens in the general election when more people are watching? She is, at best, incompetent, and at worst possibly colluding with foreign governments and murdered her employees.So she is either too incompetent to be president or she should be in jail. Those are really the only two scenarios to explain her "bad judgement". Right now she's hiding under the cover of the press. What happens when all eyeballs turn to the general and they have to start reporting what Trump says? Where will she hide then?

Bad judgement is such a relative term. Who's to say it was bad judgement when her decisions resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign countries to end up in her own pockets. The private server? That was bad judgment because it may very well put Hilary in prison. However, she likely would not have been able to enrich herself so effectively had she not set up a private server.
