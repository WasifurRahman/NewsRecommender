Budget 2016: Full coverage
Hard work left till later
Spending is up, Canberra will benefit
Canberra business leadershave welcomed the federal budget's focus on small business and tax concessions, but have warned more needs to be done to improve confidence.Treasurer Scott Morrison has used his maiden budget to deliver tax concessions to small businesses and a four-year plan to boost youth employment through paid internships.

From July 1, the government will reduce the small business tax rate to 27.5 per cent and extend thethresholdfrom businesses earning $2 million to $10 million.

The change would allow around 60,000 businesses with an estimated 1.5 million employees to receive a 2.5 per cent tax cut.CanberraBusiness Chamber chief executive Robyn Hendry said she welcomed the changes and described them as positive for many smaller businesses across the territory."The ACT is largely characterised as a small business jurisdiction so this budget is good for us," she said.The small business tax discount will be increased to 8 per cent with the threshold extended to businesses with an annual turnover of $5million.An instant write off for equipment purchases up to $20,000, whichwas set to expire in June 2017, will be extended and available to businesses earning up to $10 million a year.Businesses earning between $10 million and $25 million will also pay a lower company tax rate of 27.5 per cent from July, with the threshold progressively expanded to businesses with a turnover of $100 million in 2019-10."This will mean by 2020 more than half of all employees of companies in Australia will be in companies paying a lower tax rate of 27.5 per cent," Mr Morrison said."That's around 4.9 million employees, whose jobs will be supported by a lower tax rate in just four years."Ms Hendry said the budget also simplified tax reporting obligations for small businesses which would reduce costs and stress at the end of financial year."We are however, disappointed that the efficiency dividend targeting the public service will be continuing as it has an impact of smaller institutions, such as our galleries and libraries, which are disproportionately impacted," she said.The budget also outlined a$840 million four-year scheme to boost the employment prospects of 120,000 young Australians looking for work.The three stage scheme will provide those younger than 25 with a three week pre-employment training program to develop basic skills.They will then beplaced in a four to twelve week internship program paying $200 a fortnight, in addition to income support.Employers taking interns will receive an upfront payment of $1000 and a further $10,000 if the intern is hired, paid over six months."Australian businesses, especially small businesses, have told me they want to give young people a go, but we need to do more to get young people ready for a job, so businesses don't carry all the risk and cost," Mr Morrison said.Damien Maher, owner of Newscast Studios in Canberra's north, said the scheme would benefit a number of Canberra small businesses who wanted to employ junior staff but needed incentives."This is definitely something we would consider," he said. "As a small business we rely on younger workers coming out of university and schools and that's an incentive that will help someone employ them."Ms Hendry also welcomed the proposal and said it was pleasing to see government acknowledged the cost of hiring inexperienced staff."We believe that businesses are keen to play a role in developing staff but the cost of businesses has to be recognised," she said.Mr Maher said he was not overly confident in the state of the ACT economy and hoped small business would feel more confident after the July 2 election.As announced,the government will alsoincrease the middle income tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000 from July 1.The change has been made to stop tax bracket creep and around 500,000 taxpayers facing a the 37 per cent marginal tax rate each year.
