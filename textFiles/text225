Not their finest hour: Ssangyong Rodius By Sony Thomas, Deputy EditorAdded 13:57 | May 3, 2016 TweetPrintEmailShare Source:Supplied
Source:Supplied Celebrating the greatest cock-ups in automotive history. This week we look at the Ssangyong RodiusLondons Royal College of Art is considered one of the worlds top automotive design schools, having been the training ground for many an accomplished designer including Ian Callum and Simon Cox. It was only natural then, that Ken Greenley, who headed the department of vehicle design at the London Royal College of Art in the Nineties, was involved in styling many cars of the time, some of his highly commended works being the Aston Martin Virage coup and the 1991 Bentley Continental R, both of which he designed in association with his fellow RCA tutor John Heffernan. He also ran a consultancy, International Automotive Design, based in Worthing, southern England.So when the Ssangyong Rodius arrived in 2004, the automobile industry was justifiably perplexed to learn that Greenley was behind the hideous lines of the minivan from Korean carmaker. Featuring right at the top in several worlds ugliest car polls, the Rodius was a large seven-seater with an atrocious face, and an even more peculiar and ungainly rear, with a weirdly angled roofline. Apparently, Greenleys design objective was to capture the essence of a luxury yacht, but the resultant vehicle looked more like a large, mutated fish. It looked clumsy from almost every angle.Underneath the awkwardness, the mechanicals were loaned from Mercedes-Benz, including a 3.2-litre six-cylinder petrol and a 2.7-litre five-cylinder diesel aimed at European markets. And thanks to its enormous dimensions, the cabin offered unrivalled practicality and flexibility. But the external gawkiness was too overpowering to see through, and the Mercedes DNA and practicality couldnt help bolster sales, so the Rodius was withdrawn from most markets in 2011.TweetPrintEmailShare More NTFHNot their finest hour: Ssangyong RodiusNot their finest hour: Fuller DymaxionNot their finest hour: Vincenzo FlorioNot their finest hour: Austin MaxiNot their finest hour: MazdaNot their finest hour: BMWGhostbusters ride againNot their finest hour: Chrysler PacificaNot their finest hour: Suzuki KizashiNot their finest hour: Isuzu VehicrossNot their finest hour: Vittorio BrambillaNot their finest hour: Subaru TribecaNot their finest hour: City RoverNot their finest hour: Nissan PrimeraNot their finest hour: Chrysler CrossfireNot their finest hour: Merkur XR4TiNot their finest hour: Austin AllegroNot their finest hour: Cadillac CateraNot their finest hour: Dodge OmniNot their finest hour: Honda Element
