QUINCY - Police say a dissatisfied customer at a Wollaston clam shack threatened to shoot employees there after his order came back too small and too well done for his liking.Police said Robert Bullock, 28, of Dorchester, was arrested by State Police troopers near Neponset Circle on Saturday and charged with threatening to commit a crime, disorderly conduct and causing an evacuation. He was arraigned Monday.Capt. John Dougan said employees at Tonys Clam Shop on Quincy Shore Drive told police that Bullock placed an order around 9:45 p.m. but complained that it was too well done and sent it back. Dougan said Bullock was given a fresh order, but complained that this one was too small and began swearing at employees, threatening to "shoot this place up."Dougan said Bullock left the clam shack after making more threats and was arrested as he was entering Dorchester.
