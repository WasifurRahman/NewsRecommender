The American Family Association has been "testing" Target's new policy allowing employees and customers to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity by sending men to women's bathrooms, according to the conservative group's director of governmental affairs, Sandy Rios.
"I think theres no question that when you say that there are no barriers in the bathroom, and that if men or women feel like they are men or women, the opposite of however they are equipped, and you have no restrictions, the net effect will be, people will not be stopped," Rios told "Breitbart News Daily" on Monday. "Weve already had people testing this, going into Targets and men trying to go into bathrooms. There is absolutely no barrier."
"And so the chief concern, even more than just, I think, trauma, certainly for little girls of having men dressed like women coming in their bathrooms, the chief concern of the American Family Association is the predators who will take advantage," she added.
Last month, the American Family Association called for a boycott of Target over the store's "harmful" bathroom policy.
