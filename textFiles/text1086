Hulk Hogan files second lawsuit against Gawker

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., May 3 (UPI)
Hulk Hogan filed a second lawsuit against Gawker Monday, accusing the website of leaking a sealed transcript from his infamous sex tape.
The new suit alleges that Gawker intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him by leaking a sealed transcript of surreptitiously recorded private oral communications in a bedroom to the media, according to CNN.
The transcript was obtained and reported on by the National Enquirer in July 2015, and features the former WWE star using racial slurs to describe his daughter Brooke Hogans boyfriend. WWE quickly cut ties with Hogan, removing his name from their website where he is no longer listed as a Hall of Fame member or alumnus.
WWE is committed to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds as demonstrated by the diversity of our employees, performers and fans worldwide, the organization said at the time. Hogan, real name Terry Bollea, has since apologized for the remarks.
Hogan is coming off his recent $140 million legal victory over Gawker for releasing footage of the 62-year-old having sex with the wife of his former friend, radio host Bubba The Love Sponge Clem in 2012. Gawker will appeal the decision.
This is getting ridiculous, Gawker said in a statement. It was absurd enough that Hulk Hogan claimed $100m for emotional distress and economic damage for a story about a sex life that hed already made public. Now Hulk Hogan is blaming Gawker for racist remarks he made on another sex tape, which Gawker never had.
Its time for Hulk Hogan to take responsibility for his own words, because the only person who got Hulk Hogan fired from the WWE is Hulk Hogan, they continued.
Mr. Bollea said from the beginning that he would seek to hold all persons and entities fully responsible for their wrongful actions, Hogans legal team said in a statement. This lawsuit seeks to do just that.
