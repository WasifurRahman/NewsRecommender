Because it was way overvalued and commodities are going up?
Thailand economy is not that bad. Everyone works here unlike the welfare state of USA.
The US is far from a welfare state. Just because full timeemployees at Walmart and many
other companies are on food stamps and medicade does not make it a welfare state, It just
means the government is dysfunctional when it comes to legislating a minimum wage to the
benefit of the family ownership. The 1% downloading responsibility to the middle class.

Some of us have been warning about the inevitable decline of the US dollar for some time now...
The US unpayable debt...creating money out of thin air and flooding the market place with dollars when the US economy has been in recession for years...has damaged US Fed and Central Banking credibility...other countries are dumping dollars...other countries are tired of US BS and are beginning to trade for oil in other currencies...other countries do not want to buy US Bonds to help support the US government because of the US leadership's inability to control spending...
The best stores of wealth on the planet are land (location is very important) and Precious Metals (Gold and Silver)
Good Luck!
I've been reading about the demise of the US dollar for many, many, many years. The US economy may not be rocking, but it's far from falling apart. Won't happen in our lifetimes.
Your view is not held by the Saudi, Russians, and Chinese...who hold much of the US sovereign debt...these countries are slowly trying to uncouple from the US dollar without completely destroying the US government and economy...their investment in dollars is at stake here...they could get pissed and dump them on the market at anytime...causing the demise of the dollar...
Not likely to happen tomorrow...but the purchasing and political power of the dollar is in decline and will continue to be so...
I am 71 now...the collapse in the confidence of the US dollar...at home and abroad... will happen in my lifetime...
