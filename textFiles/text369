There is a district hospital in the town, and a number of shops and pubs, such as Morrissey's Pub, which claims to be the oldest in Ireland. The Father Breen Park forms the nexus for a great many activities, providing fields for soccer, football and other sports, while the adjacent CYMS hall is home to numerous clubs, such as boxing and Tae-Kwon-Do. Heritage House also provides guided tours of the museum and runs workshops throughout the year - training and meeting rooms are available.
