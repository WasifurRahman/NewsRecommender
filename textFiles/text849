A Prophetic Cry to Put an End to Friendly-Fire in the Body of Christ
9:25AM EDT 5/3/2012
Jennifer
LeClaire
Jennifer LeClaire is now sharing her reflections and revelations through Walking in the Spirit, a new podcast from Charisma. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.God canand often doesspeak through natural encounters in our everyday lives. So when I saw two U.S. Army soldiers pumping gas in the car next to mine last weekand when my spirit suddenly went on high alertI knew the Lord was trying to show me something.See, I used to live a mile outside the gate of Fort Rucker in Ozark, Ala. Interacting with military personnel was part of everyday life. But since I returned to South Florida 10 years ago I havent seen a single military man (or woman). At least not one in uniform. These men were dressed in their camouflage gear complete with boots. No one else seemed to notice them, but I couldnt take my spiritual eyes or ears off them.As I watched and listened to how they interacted, I was impressed with both the camaraderie and respect they showed one another. I noticed at least one of them had been deployedrisking his life for the security of the nationand returned home safely from war by the patch on his sleeve. Finally, before they left, I stepped out and thanked them for serving our country. The majors smiling response: Its our pleasure. Humble.When I got back in my car, I asked the Lord what that was all about. He said, What if these soldiers were out in the middle of the battlefield arguing with each other?
What would happen is this: They would leave themselves open for a blindside from the enemy. Soldiers on the battlefield must have one anothers backs. They cant be found arguing over who is the greatest or whether or not the corners on their bunk beds were tucked in tightly enough that morning. In other words, theres no room for petty arguments over non-essential matters. Lives are on the line. Soldiers in the U.S. Army have to lay aside personal preferencesand personal ambitionfor the good of their unit. Beloved, we are not only the bride of Christ; we are also soldiers in the army of the Lord. We are in a spiritual war. Lives are on the line. Good soldierssoldiers that are ultimately promoted to higher ranksare motivated by the mission. Seasoned soldiers in the army of the Lord are devoted to one another in love and honor one another above themselves (Rom. 12:10). Many have taken bullets for their fellow soldiersbullets they didnt have to takein the name of executing the battle strategy or keeping a senior officer (or just a fellow soldier) safe. We call them heroes and give them silver stars.Yet too often soldiers in the army of the Lord are struck with so-called friendly fire that they never saw coming. Why is there so much bickering among us? Why is there so much striving for promotion? Why are there so many personal attacks? Im not talking about calling out error or sin. I am talking about mean-spirited critical, judgmental, personal attacks that hit below the belt. My brethren, this ought not be so. Thats not the spirit of Christ. And it needs to stop. Now.

Christian ministry isnt a corporate ladder where you step on those around you to get to the top. Christian ministry isnt a forum to call out the faults of your fellow soldiers to prove your own worth. Christian ministry isnt an open invitation for so-called believers to hurl fiery darts at one another on the enemys behalf. So what is Christian ministry? Well, James said pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world (James 1:27). Christian ministry is doing what God has called you to do in the right spiritwithout following the worlds way. Pure Christian ministry demands a self-sacrificing spirit that trusts God to promote you, to vindicate you, or to do whatever else you need done by His grace and in His timing.Im reminded of Jesus Sermon on the Mount. Jesus called blessed those who are poor in spirit, those who mourn over sin, those who are meek, those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, those who are merciful, those who are pure in heart, those who are peacemakers, and those who are persecuted for righteousness sake (Matt. 5:3-10). The Beatitudes portray the core of the character of a mature soldier in the army of the Lord. These core values go against the grain of the world system that pushes us to perform for earthly rewards and recognition. These values encourage us to pursue a relationship with the Father that will cause us to walk in humility, be quick to repent, be kind and gentle, seek first the kingdom of God, show mercy, purify our motives, seek peace with all men and endure the persecution that comes with walking out the Sermon on the Mount lifestyle. If U.S. soldiersmany of whom are not even Christianscan display such integrity of character and devotion to one anothers wellbeing, cant we? Selah.Jennifer LeClaire is news editor at Charisma.
