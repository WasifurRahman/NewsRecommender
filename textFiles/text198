Android under antitrust investigation both in the US and in the EU.
ANTITRUST: According to the Wall Street Journalthe american Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is extending its investigation of Androids alleged antitrust practices. Only last week the EU Commission officially found Google in breach of antitrust ruleswith regard to Android.
The FTC probe of Android and its presumed use of anticompetitive tactics at the expense of rival search and services started in September 2015.According to the Wall Street Journal, the FTC is now "hoping to access some of the evidence behind European regulators case.
Commentators note that the outcome of the FTC investigation might differ significantly from the one being conducted in the EU. The first reason is a sensible difference in Android market share, which in Europe reaches 70%, while in the US it runs 59% of smartphones. Moreover, the FTC might make a similar decision to the one that concluded the antitrust investigation of Google with regard to search services back in 2013 when the Commission decided against filing a lawsuit in consideration of the fact that Googles actions "had legitimate business justifications and improved experiences for () users, even if the conduct impeded rival firms".
