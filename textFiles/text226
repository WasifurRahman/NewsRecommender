Chelsea Foundation team flourish
Chelsea Foundation team flourish

Tue 3 May 2016
The Chelsea Foundations adult cerebral palsy team have enjoyed a year to remember after securing the National League Southern Conference in their debut season.
Formed this season the squad, whose youngest player is 16, have excelled in the Southern Conference winning 11 and drawing just one of their 12 fixtures on route to lifting the title.
As league winners the team have also qualified to play in the FA Disability Cup at St Georges Park next month, while they will be guests of honour for our final Premier League fixture of the season against Leicester City.
The players and staff will parade the trophy on the pitch at half time and Chelsea Foundation disability inclusion assistant and team manager Andy Rose is delighted his players will get the opportunity to showcase their success in front of the Stamford Bridge faithful.
He said: At Chelsea we pride ourselves on being one club, from top to bottom and allowing these players the chance to walk out at Stamford Bridge is a shining example of this.
When we embarked on this journey at the beginning of the season, myself, the coaches and players were a little apprehensive.
Needless to say we neednt have been. The players have performed fantastically well all season. I am immensely proud of all of them.
Our ethos has always been to ensure that every player of every ability has the same opportunity to play.
As team manager I am immensely proud of their commitment, professionalism and attitude. Winning the title is the reward they deserve.
Foundation disability inclusion officer Rob Seale added: Our newly formed cerebral palsy team has exceeded every expectation this season.
Theyve managed to win the league without losing a game, and have the best record in the country. This is even more impressive when you consider the teams ethos is to include players of all abilities and to give everyone an equal opportunity to play competitive football.
The players and coaches should be very proud of what theyve achieved so far.
