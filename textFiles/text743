Stone Brewing CEO Greg Koch sets up $100m craft brewing investment firm
DBR Staff Writer
Published 03 May 2016
Stone Brewing CEO and co-founder Greg Koch has set up a $100m company called True Craft thatfocuses on investing in craft breweries.
The newly formed company will make minority investments in breweries, allowing them to run their independently and control operations.Stone Brewing founder and CEO Greg Koch was quoted by USA Today as saying: "Some people start companies to sell out. Some start companies because they are compelled to follow their passion. True Craft is for the latter."Craft beer needs an alternative model to the one that requires founders to sell their company in its entirety. In a world in which there are constant forces toward homogenization and fitting in, I specifically want to foster a world of uniqueness, depth and character."The new venture has received a $100m investment from an investor group.The announcement was made at the EG 2016 Conference in Carmel-by-the-sea, California.Koch said: "We also have a small group of the best craft breweries interested in joining."Stone Brewing co-founder and president Steve Wagner said: "This is about setting up a consortium so we cannot just survive, but continue to thrive in a world in which craft is being co-opted by Big Beer."This allows companies like Stone to follow an ethos that involves independence and passion for the artisanal. By investing in True Craft now, we can be confident that our vision is locked in beyond our professional lifetimes and we feel privileged to help others in our industry do the same."More details of True Craft will be revealed later on by the two founders.Image: Stone Brewing CEO sets up craft brewing investment company.
