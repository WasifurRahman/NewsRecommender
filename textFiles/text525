AT CLEMSON, HOAX AND A COVERUP?
Recently, Clemson students have been the victims of a smear campaign. Individuals on social media and around campus have claimed that the Clemson student body is racist.
On Monday, April 11, a controversial image surfaced on social media.
The image circulated online displayed four bananas hung on a poster dedicated to Clemsons African-American heritage.
In the following nine days of protest, five students were arrested and the administration mandated new diversity and inclusivity training for all students and faculty.
Some lower level administration even attended and endorsed the protests, giving credibility to the smear campaign.
The administration as a whole genuflected to the protesters demands, granting the smear further substance.
Since campus wide unrest was the direct result of the four bananas being hung it seems natural to ask who hung the bananas and what their motivations were.
The Clemson administration knows the answers to these questions, but has not revealed them.
The only thing most people on campus are aware of is the suspicious behavior and activity from the administration and the student protest leaders.
This leads to more questions than answers. . . .
There have been allegations on campus that the student who placed the bananas on the banner in the first place was African American.
The implication is that the student intended for the incident to incite a campus protest.
If this is not the case, why has the administration not released any information about the race or motives of the student who placed the bananas?
As it turns out, no charges (criminal or disciplinary) were brought against this student.
If the act was supposedly so racist that the administration has decided to start assigning mandatory diversity and inclusivity training to faculty and students, then why was the individual not sanctioned?
And if the individual was not sanctioned because she or he did not place the bananas in an act of racism, why are administrators and student activists still claiming the campus has a racially discriminatory environment?
Suspiciously, the identity of the student who posted threatening messages to Yik Yak was released to the public, amid calls for the university to do so.
Yet, the identity of the person who placed the bananas is being kept a secret. Why are they so interested in this banana vandals privacy?
Stay tuned.

You'd think bananas would be sexist, not racist.

Somebody like Dinesh D'souza should make a documentary about all the rape and race hoaxes perpetrated by leftists starting with Tawanna Brawley. There is plenty of material to work with. Just call it "Hoax".

Hoaxes add noise to the signal of actual cases of racial prejudice.
It was a pretty clear signal before all of the SJWs got involved creating hoaxes.
As the value of the signal decreases in respect to the hoaxes, the public will begin to peg any new case as a hoax as they will far outnumber the actual, real cases that crop up.
This makes it more likely that actual racial prejudice will increase...until the hoaxers are put in jail for defaming individuals, groups of people and entire organizations.This is what happens when 'virtue signalling' goes beyond any reasonable bounds: it becomes counter-productive.

The hoaxes are being "added to the signal" because the signal had gotten embarrassingly small without the hoaxes, there were too few actual acts of hate going on to justify doing anything about them. But the left wants to do these things, and needs an at least facially plausible excuse.So, fake hoaxes. The modern Reichstag fire.And, yes, the administration at Clemson is in on it. Certainly after the fact, and you can't rule out their being in on it from the beginning.

Another "hate crime" hoax, eh? Why am I not surprised? As an aside, are college kids so stupid these days that they can't even get away with a simple hoax anymore? It can't be *that* difficult.
