I have seen this from a long time that im always getting less rewards in outfit with my friends and they get more even when
I am dealing more damage. In a two man outfit i get less than 50% rewards even if i deal more damage.
I testes it on a cube and i was getting like 496 uridium and my friend was getting 528.
Is this in game thing or a bug?

On the Cube are you using SAB while the friend is using regular lasers?
The SAB does no damage and thus does not register as damage.
This is why so many people have trouble with "leachers" as they are doing damage while the main person is taking out the shields.
You are better comparing the regular NPC's instead of shared damage ones like the Cubikon.
I seem to always see a true split according to the number in the group and whether they are active in battle (attacking or being attacked) while the NPC was being killed.

No no im talking about main hp damage , also i have seen it in case of Bks or any group hunting when i pop aliens with my friends they get more than me I suspect it is due to the rank or something but i dont know.

The difference could be due to rank.
