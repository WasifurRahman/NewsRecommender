Hundreds of people lined the streets to welcome the Tour de Yorkshire to Nottinghamshire at the weekend.
The event passed through Harworth and Bircotes on Saturday, with yellow bikes and yellow t-shirts lining the route.
The Tour de Yorkshire Womens Race heads through Harworth.
During the race, World Champion Lizzie Armistead cycled past the Tom Simpson memorial, outside Harworth and Bircotes Sports and Social Club.
Tom was one of Britains most successful cyclists before he was tragically killed while competing in the Tour de France in 1967.
Councillor Alan Rhodes, Leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, said: Tom Simpson was a history maker as the first British rider to wear the yellow jersey (Tour de France, 1962) and Britains first world road race champion in 1965, the same year he won the Giro di Lombardia. Nottinghamshire has been extremely proud to be able to welcome the Tour de Yorkshire in tribute to him, as we also welcomed some of the top names in world cycling to Harworth and Bircotes.
