Rebels, namesakes give sleepless nights to candidates in KeralaThe last date for withdrawing nominations ended on Monday and 1203 candidates are in the fray for 140 seatsPublished: 16:06 May 3, 2016 PTIAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisThiruvananthapuram: With campaign intensifying for the May 16 Assembly polls in the state, rebel candidates and namesakes are posing a threat to winning prospects of candidates, especially to those of Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), in some constituencies in Kerala.While UDF candidates face rebel threat the most, including on many seats they currently hold, Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seem to have fewer number of rebels as per the final candidates list.The last date for withdrawing nominations ended on Monday and 1,203 candidates are in the fray for 140 seats.Even though the main battle is between UDF and LDF, the NDA has made the electoral contest triangular in many constituencies.K.C. Joseph, states Minister for Rural Development and a close confidant of Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, who is seeking eighth term to the Assembly from Irikkur, is among the prominent UDF candidates facing rebel threat.It is significant that Josephs candidature had been objected to by local Congress workers. However, ignoring the protest, the party leadership decided to field him.Rebel Congress leader Binoy Thomas is taking on Joseph under the banner Save Congress. Sitting Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) P. C. Vishnunath (Chengannur), K. M. Shaji (Azhikode), and Dominic Presentation (Kochi) are also facing the rebel threat.Former MLA Shobhana George, who was denied ticket this time, is actively campaigning against Vishnunath.Once a strong loyalist of former chief minister late K. Karunakaran, Shobhana had filed her nomination papers in the last assembly polls also. But she withdrew at the last minute following the intervention by senior party leaders.However, Shobhana refused to budge to the party leadership pressure this time. She said she has decided to contest this time as the party leadership failed to meet the promise that she would be given a ticket this time.K. M. Shaji, who is contesting against CPMs journalist-turned candidate M. V. Nikesh Kumar, is facing a huge threat from P. K. Ragesh, who came into the limelight after winning as rebel against the official candidate in the last civic polls.Former district panchayat member K. J. Lenus is threatening the winning prospects of Kochi MLA Dominic Presentation while Kerala Congress (M) leader C.F. Thomas is facing stiff challenge from Youth Congress leader K. Suresh who is contesting as an Independent in Changanassery.Namesakes, who ensured many prominent candidates did not win in the previous polls, are in fray in some constituencies this time as well.The RMP candidate in Vadakara and widow of T.P. Chandrasekharan, K. K. Rema, is one of the contestants facing such a threat.UDFs K. S. Sabarinathan and K. Babu, LDFs Antony Raju and M. Swaraj are also facing similar threats in their respective constituencies.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from India India: Forest guards held over rhino poaching12 minutes agoMuslims hold key for Mamatas return into power14 minutes agoIndia has jurisdiction in Italian marine case15 minutes agoLong road ahead for Mamatas Trinamool Congress26 minutes agoRebels, namesakes spoil candidates chances29 minutes agoIndia: Key candidates fighting West Bengal polls45 minutes agoNirbhaya-like rape-murder of girl stuns Kerala03:04 pmForest fires can cause glacier melting, floods02:55 pm filed underGulfNewsNewsAsiaIndiaAlso In IndiaEnclave dwellers to vote for first time since 					Framed Gallery Shiite pilgrims converge on Baghdad shrineUS cruise in decades docks in Havana
