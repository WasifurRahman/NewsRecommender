A Gold Coast police officer with the elite Rapid Action Patrol squad repeatedly struck a man in the head and kneed him in the chest during an arrest, a court has heard.Senior Constable Aaron Minns was charged with four counts of common assault over a spate of alleged incidents between September 2014 and January 2015.He has pleaded not guilty to all four charges.Police prosecutor David Gore on Tuesday said Sen.ConstMinns was accused of using unnecessary force on three suspects, including one who was apprehended at Mudgeeraba after a car chase in September 2014.

Gardener Todd Schinkel told the Brisbane Magistrates Court officers "started getting into me" after he surrendered and was being handcuffed.Constable Matthew Austin was part of the arrest and said he saw Sen. Const Minns repeatedly strike the man."I saw the fist come down and just three or four strikes to the top of the head area," he said.Under cross-examination by defence counsel Stephen Zillman, Const Austin said he didn't report the incident over any suspected misconduct because he didn't think it warranted it at the time.Senior Constable James Murdoch also gave evidence he saw Mr Schinkel's body move physically upward when he was kneed in the chest after being cuffed and lifted to his feet.Following this, Sen.Const Murdoch said he exchanged words to the effect of "there's a f---ing camera over there" with the accused.Before Sen.ConstMinns was suspended from duty last year, he worked with the elite Rapid Action Patrol group which was featured in the reality TV show Gold Coast Cops.Mr Schinkel later received treatment at the Gold Coast University Hospital for a police dog bite to his shoulder, the court heard.The hearing continues before Magistrate Noel Nunan.AAP
