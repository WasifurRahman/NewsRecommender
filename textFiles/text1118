Hey, these are amateurs. Just be glad they sparkle.The delightful mess ended with a rushed double elimination most of us saw coming. The first to go: NFL star Von Miller and his partner Witney Carson, who brazenly committed Houghery in the first degree during their otherwise satisfactory Elvis Presley-themed salsa.Eat your heart out, Derek! For one night only, there was a new Latin-loving crotch-bobber in town.Von had finally, almost begrudgingly, begun to warm up in the last two weeks, whereas the other eliminated couple,The Facts of Life star Kim Fields and her partner Sasha Fierce Farber,hadbeen trying super hard from day one. Kim was shocked to be sent home after earning straight 9s on this weeks high-energy ABC samba, which seemed to take place at 123 Sesame Street.She may never know if they were Pity 9s or Real 9s. But does the correct interpretation really matter? You take them both, and there you haveem.Will the judges please reveal their scores? Carrie Ann Inahhhhh-ber! Nyle DiMarco and Peta Murgatroyd: 28/30 foxtrot + 28/30 Team James Brown = 56/60 After being confidence-shamed by Len last week,the deaf top model spent much of rehearsal time afraid to sign anything cocky. Nevertheless, Len managed to swipe at him from the other, more technical end, complaining that Nyles bum stuck out throughout theirBeautiful Day foxtrot.No ones complaining! cried Bruno, speaking for everyone else in the bum-loving crowd. Tragically, they all turned on Mr. Tonioli after he tried to score Nyle a 10 even though the judges official scrap paper definitely said 9. Wanya Morris and Lindsay Arnold: 27/30 foxtrot + 28/30 Team James Brown = 55/60 Despite a Boyz II Men-related commitment in NYC that kept him from team freestyle practice (and on the phone in L.A. sounding quasi-important), Wanya managed to serve as both head cheerleader and the guy who drummed out the beat of the James Brown medley on Nyles shoulders so Nyle could lead the pack through some jazzy lurches. Thats teamwork. Is there anything this original boy bander cant do? Yes: Pray hard enough for 10s! Wanya and Lindsays foxtrot, set to Aretha Franklins I Say a Little Prayer, fell just short of the judges most gilded paddles. Len loved itswhimsy and joy, but pointed out, much to Wanyas able-bodied surprise, that hed somehow lost his neck.Carrie Ann eloquently explained that she expected Jyeahhh!!! from this dance, but it only ended up being Yayyyyy for her. Very helpful. He must know exactly what to do to fix that.Paige VanZant and Mark Ballas: 30/30 jive + 25/30 Team Beyonc = 55/60Who runs the world of Tina Turner impressions in a ballroom setting?Read MorePaige! This couples Proud Mary jive was jam-packed with difficult technical content and acrobatics
in particular, a cartwheel situation in which Paige and Mark appeared to be fighting each other UFC-style while a giant killer cheese grater loomed above.Back away from the potential frontrunners, grater! These two still have plenty of aging to do in the next few weeks. We must preserve their unique flavor.Ginger Zee and Valentin Chmerkovskiy: 30/30 Viennese waltz + 25/30 Team Beyonc = 55/60 Lesser entertainers have crumbled under the pressure, but GMAs chief meteorologist has proven well-suited to weather Vals stormyYou must be better/PLEASE DONT PANIC training style. Can he help that hes so passionate? Our Pro just wants his partner to look the best she can!The pair earned the first perfect 30 of the season for a romantic Viennese waltz set to I Have Nothing: Namely, The Rights To The Whitney Houston Original
a lesser-known cover of the iconic hit. Their chemistry and Gingers long white gown couldnt have been stronger, but technically this fell short of perfect for me. Shes simply not the dancer Val and the network want her to be. But shes trying.Antonio Brown and Sharna Burgess: 24/30 tango + 28/30 Team James Brown = 52/60The last remaining NFL star and his smoldering flame of a partner gave great face during their solo tango, but were ultimately overwhelmed by the elaborate staging, background druids, and furious nature of the Rolling Stones Paint It Black.Carrie Ann insisted theres a hidden reserve of magic Antonio can tap into if he remembers that each dance is not a sprint, but a series of nuanced moves
the little steps leading up to the big plays. As this wizard is still becoming aware of his own powers, he did not notice Sharnas boob popping out at the end of their dance in time to cover it up. Too much going on, really. The netting, the patterns, the windswept hair, Darth VaderSo Tom made a big deal about it instead, via the Nip Slip Police in his earpiece, and all was perfectly awkward.Whoops! Crisis achieved.Jodie Sweetin and Keo Motsepe: 26/30 quickstep + 25/30 Team Beyonc = 51/60 Its too bad Jodie danced first this week
the judges might have better appreciated her charmingquickstep set to Stevie Wonders For Once In My Life if theyd had more time to soften up.Or would they have had it out for Keo either way? Carrie Ann insisted he missed a step on the Charleston and failed to keep Jodie in the right contact throughout the dance. Isnt this supposed to be about her performance, not his? If she danced it correctly, what is the problem? Regardless, this was a much better week for the Fuller House star than the low-hummed critical fanfare would suggest.Fronting Team Beyonc with an extra dose of attitude never hurt anyone, either.Be sure to bedazzle your texting thumbs for next week, when America becomes the fourth judge!XOXO,Fringe FairyDancing With the Stars airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.#recap#recaps#dwts#dwts22#dancing-with-the-stars#featuredReblogShareTweetPin itSendWhat to Read Next'Dancing With the Stars' recap: Define'Famous'Yahoo TV'Dancing With the Stars' recap: The Switch-UpYahoo TV'Dancing With the Stars'Recap: Misty Watercolor MemoriesYahoo TVDead Men and Women Walking: Where Our Favorite 'Game of Thrones' Victims Are NowYahoo TVKanye West Gave Off Major Wolf Vibes at the Met GalaLauren Tuck'SpongeBob SquarePants'Sneak Peek: It's 'Happy Days'in Bikini BottomYahoo TV12 Shows to Binge This SpringYahoo TV'Game of Thrones': 15 of the Show's Most Gruesome DeathsYahoo TVLady Gaga Dressed as Her Old Self at the Met GalaNora Crotty'Castle' Sneak Peek: Guess Who's Behind Door No. 1?Yahoo TV'Game of Thrones':A Power Ranking of the Deadliest Fantastical Creatures in WesterosYahoo TVDoris Roberts: Her Most Memorable TV RolesYahoo TVAlex Rodriguez and Anne Wojcicki Make Red Carpet Debut as a Couple at the Met GalaTaryn Ryder'Saturday Night Live' #TBT: Remember When Robert Downey Jr. Was a Cast Member?Yahoo TV'Game of Thrones' Quiz: Why Is Sansa Frowning?Yahoo TV'Game of Thrones': The 10 Best Action SequencesYahoo TVKate Upton Is Engaged, Flaunts Huge Diamond Ring at Met GalaTaryn Ryder'Little Big Shots' Sneak Peek: Steve Harvey Gets Schooled on LoveYahoo TV'Strong' Host Gabrielle Reece Shows Us Her Dream Gig and Her Dream GymYahoo TV'Game of Thrones': Who Is on Arya's Kill List?Yahoo TVKarlie Kloss Actually Cut Off Half Her Dress For A Met Gala After PartySabrina Carder'Scandal' Tweet-cap: Jake's Daddy IssuesYahoo TV'Gilmore Girls': First Look at Netflix's RevivalYahoo TV'The Night Manager' Pics:Tom Hiddleston is Sexy All Over the GlobeYahoo TVThe Final Box-Office Verdict for 'Batman v.
