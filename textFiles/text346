Kim Kardashian in silver Balmain at the Met Gala: surprisingly great?

#VIBES.
Thats how Kanye West answered a question about his blue-contacts.
Vibes.
Kanye tried out the robot-theme of the Met Gala by vibing with some robot eyes, I guess.
He also wore jeans and a crazy, blinged-out Balmain jacket.
Kim Kardashian also did Balmain, and you guys, she NEVER learns.
Shes lost so much weight in the past four months, shes worked so hard and she wanted to look thin for the Met Gala, and then she wore a Balmain dress that adds like twenty pounds to her frame.
Now, all that being said Kims Balmain dress was one of the best looks on the carpet.
Go ahead and yell at me!!!
But the construction is great and its easily one of the best of the silver/metallic dresses at the Met Gala.
Lucifers Homegirl
Kris Jenner
also wore Balmain, and she brought her boyfriend Corey Gamble.
You know what?
Im not going to shade Kris Jenner here.
Three of her daughters came to the event and she was proud of them, and she thankfully didnt try to pull focus from them.
This is a simple black gown, no drama.
The Balmain Army was out in full force last night
there were SO MANY models wearing shiny Balmain dresses.
Heres a shot of Doutzen Kroes, Alessandra Ambrosio and Jourdan Dunn, all in Balmain.
I think Jourdans dress is probably the most on-theme.

I agree.
The dress is probably one the best she has ever worn, but is so heavy and makes her look heavy.

I agree, it really feels like its weighing her down. On somebody lean, I think it wouldve looked amazing. Im picturing Karlie Kloss in it. Also, I think Jourdan Dunn was the best look of the night
why does she not have more pics?!?!
I also think Doutzen looks great. Her dress reminds me of Fifth Element. Classy, yet still true to the theme (without going overboard).

Kim does look pretty but how similar are all of those dresses? When she came on the carpet all I could think was
didnt I see this already tonight? They are pretty much the same dress just in a different material with a slight change here and there. Balmains act is getting old. (A few months back Kylie wore a dress that is dead on for Alessandras) so in reality its same thing different day for them. Yawn. Good to see that Kanye brought out his nice jeans for the event.
As far as Kris, that dress made her look heavy and that choker made it even worse. It didnt photograph well either. Guess that was Kims payback to her for the 72 day wedding comment. Lol.

Kim looks good but her face looks different. Once again.
Her body is not just a result of diet, she obviously had lipo in certain places and I am sure she is spanxed into oblivion under that dress.
But she doesnt look ridicolous. She looks ok. That dress would look good on anybody though.
Kris dress is terrible and ill fitting. It makes her look huge.
Kanye looks extra douchey with blue contacts and that jacket belongs to Liberace.
God forbid they crack a smile every so often. Geesh. Lighten up!

Balmain is the epitome of tastelessness, in every sense of the word. Its ugly and its pretentious
made for people who only want to show off how much money they have. That said, the contac lenses are probably the best part about the outfit.
I do like the white dress though, whoever is wearing it. Are you sure thats Balmain as well?

Still makes me crazy how Kanye gets to be all comfy at these events and Kim has metal digging into her body. Looks like hes too mellow to even help her up the stairs there.

I actually love Kims dress but I saw a pic of the back where someone commented that her butt looked like an overdone Jiffy Pop and thats all I can see now.
I love Joudan Dunns dress! I quite like Balmain here.

Kanye needs to learn some manners, shes wearing high heels, a tight dress walking up stairs, he just stands there like that time when she was pregnant and he didnt help her out of the car, and
had her open the door for him.
(Im not saying that youre helpless when youre pregnant or that you need someone to do everything for you, just that a gentleman is appreciatedright?)

Counterpoint: Unsurprisingly, Kim is in something unflattering and ugly. Also, Kanyes top half and bottom half appear to have dressed themselves for separate events.
Re Yeezy helping her, i suspect that everyone is under strict instructions not to put their arms up around her in case it blocks a precious, precious pap photonobody is ever helping her even as she waddles pathetically along, and she has also put down North in order to do a solo pap stroll. Shes actually holding his hand to hoist herself along, while he keeps it at his side.

Even on a 6ft tall slim model that silver fish scale concoction would be too much. On Kim it makes her look like something wrapped up for the oven. I mean, the reason some of you like it may have to do with the fact that its not nude Spanx and the sheer relief from not seeing her in a nude onesie just makes you giddy:-) (i joke, somewhat)
Ye looks too ridiculous for words. I am sure he got dressed for the Walking Dead wrap-up party instead. Homegirl Kris is rocking some abuelita Black Widow couture, and I see she paid the cash bonus to her beard
look at that bling on the budget Casper!
I do like Doutzens dress, but that is it. Jourdan looks like she is wearing the 2016 MacGyver foil tape runway creation, and the sad doily on Alessandra cant be saved even by someone as pretty as her.

It continues to shock me that with all her financial resources and connections, Kim cannot dress in a flattering way for her body.
She was such a pretty, exotic, and gorgeous woman once.
Sad.
And the contacts on Kayne.they freak me out a little LOL

Kim looks chunky and stocky.
That sounds mean, and I wouldn say it if she hadnt been all over the he media crowing about her massive weight loss. Her other half looks pretty terrible.
I quite like the dresses in the line up though.

Actually Alessandras Dress shows the theme the best since its a modern gown completely made of old handtechniques. Shes combining yet also contrasting old and new styles & techniques, which was the brief.
kanye also did well by combining and contrasting within the theme.
Looking like a shiny futuristic robot was not the brief at all.

sisi, i totally agree with you!
alessandras dress is appropriate, gorgeous, and she looked stunning. also, as much as it pains me to say it, i liked the idea behind kanyes look. im not a fan of his, but the jacket was amazing, and i think it totally worked with the contacts. i also think the jeans were a surprisingly good choice, i just wish they were dark denim instead.
as for kim, she really needs to stop doing that wet look with her hair. rather than looking intentional, it just looks greasy.
as for her dress, i actually dont think it adds a ton of extra weight to her frame. i think thats exactly how her body looks these days, which is fine given that she just had her son 5 months ago. (that being said, i dont like the dress on her. it seems a bit try-hard, mostly because shes the one wearing it and shes the epitome of try-hard.)

fantastic that denim
was showcased by someone, its the perfect base canvas that symbolises mass produce, industrial revolution, evolution in fashion, and the relationship between lowbrow & highbrow. The hand applied decoration blends the two parts of the theme together.
Im not a fan of this K-duo in general either, in fact I cannot stand them, but Kanyes look was excellent in my opinion. He basically did the opposite of SJP.
Sarah Jessica Parker took the most elaborate style period ever and wore a minimalistic modern massproducable leasurewear version of it, Kanye took a mass market item and took it to the most elaborate handdecorated unique extreme. Both referenced turningpoints in fashionhistory, yet wore something that was a new thing of its own.
Both are part of my faves list.

I hate Balmain, but Jourdan was one of the best dressed imo. Doutzen is stunning as usual and Kim is the usual Kim who refuses to wear anything remotely flattering for her body.

Now she looks 139 pounds here.
This dress isnt flattering.
But it also shows me how much she photoshops her photos before they get out, because here it shows she still has weight on.
Whereas, in many of her other photos she didnt look 139 pounds to me on such a short woman.

Well in kanyes defense, impersonating a robot when you actually are one probably proved challenging.

Kims make-up was terrible
she looks like shes been throwing up for the past week
pasty and exhausted. And the dress itself is fine, but not on her figure. Its never a win to dress in something that adds so many pounds and makes you look dumpy. I think the bar is set so so low for her that people cheer when shes not near-naked, but from an objective standpoint, this look is far from a winner.

This is probably a very sad but true
