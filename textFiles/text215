Ad metrics: is it time to leave the impression behind?
METRICS: The metrics that are used to sell online advertising are at the root of many of the problems that digital publishers face today, according to this article by the International Business Times. The main issue is that the metric that was traditionally used to sell print advertising, impressions, was transferred to digital ad sales 20 years ago.
This was done without much consideration for the consequences, and according to the article, has distorted and perverted the digital publishing industry, for example by prioritising scale at the expense of quality long-form content.
Publishers are now increasingly replacing impressions with a time-based currency to sell their advertising space. One of the most notable examples is the Financial Times, who uses cost per hour instead of the industry standard CPM, or cost per mille (thousand). FT is now leading a group of 30 companies that are trying to build support for using time-based currencies to sell ads.
Moving from impressions would mean rethinking "20 years of inertia and billions of dollars in infrastructure built to transact on impressions", the article notes, so any agreement on a new standard would be "a mammoth undertaking" indeed.
