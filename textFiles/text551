When Apple announced in 2013 that its next iPhone would include a fingerprint reader, it touted the feature as a leap forward in security. Many people dont set up a passcode on their phones, Apple SVP Phil Schiller said at the keynote event where the Touch ID sensor was unveiled, but making security easier and faster might convince more users to protect their phones. (Of course, Apple wasnt the first to stuff a fingerprint reader into a flagship smartphone, but the iPhones Touch ID took the feature mainstream.)The system itself proved quite securescanned fingerprints are stored, encrypted, and processed locally rather than being sent to Apple for verificationbut the widespread use of fingerprint data to unlock iPhones worried some experts. One of the biggest questions that hung over the transition was legal rather than technical: How might a fingerprint-secured iPhone be treated in a court of law?The question went unanswered for a year, until a Virginia judge ruled in 2014 that police can force users to unlock their smartphones with their fingerprints. But until this February, when a federal judge in Los Angeles signed a search warrant that required a woman to use her fingerprint to unlock her iPhone, it didnt appear that any federal law-enforcement agency had ever used that power.The iPhone belonged to Paytsar Bkhchadzhyan, the 29-year-old girlfriend of a man accused of being a member of an Armenian gang, according to Matt Hamilton and Richard Winton of the LA Times. She was sentenced in February for one count of identity theft, and just 45 minutes later, a federal judge signed a warrant authorizing law-enforcement officers to place her finger or thumb on the Touch ID sensor of her iPhone. Its not clear what prosecutors are searching for on her phone.The warrant was first discovered by Thomas Fox-Brewster of Forbes in March. Fox-Brewster examined hundreds of court documents but wasnt able to find any previous example of a federal warrant for device-unlocking fingerprints.The federal judge in Los Angeles may have moved quickly to sign and execute the warrant because theres only a 48-hour window during which an iPhone will accept its users fingerprints. After that windowor after a restartthe phone will require a PIN or passcode to unlock.The Fifth Amendment, which protects people from incriminating themselves during legal proceedings, prevents the government from compelling someone to turn over a memorized PIN or passcode. But fingerprints, like other biometric indicatorsDNA, handwriting samples, your likenesshave long been considered fair game, because they dont reveal anything in your mind. (Marcia Hofmann, a digital-rights lawyer, wrote a comprehensive rundown of the question in late 2013, when it was still hypothetical.)Now that its clear that police are willing to ask for warrants for phone-unlocking fingerprintsand that judges are willing to sign themsecurity-conscious smartphone users are faced with a menu of mostly unsavory options.A fingerprint and a long passcode provides a good balance between convenience and securityor it did, until courts began compelling fingerprint unlocks, said Chris Soghoian, the chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. The alternatives are worse: A short PIN lets you use your phone like a human, Soghoian said, but can be guessed by a computer algorithm in certain cases. And a long passcode, while secure, is a pain to type in every time you want to check Tinder.The only way to turn off an iPhones fingerprint-reader on the flywithout waiting for the 48-hour window to expireis to turn it off. When its powered back on, it will ask for the devices PIN or passcode, and wont accept fingerprints. (If Bkhchadzhyans phone was off when police found it in her boyfriends home, her fingerprints wont unlock it.)Since Apple began encrypting its iPhones in 2014 and rolled out further security improvements alongside Touch ID, law enforcement has had to get increasingly creative to access the contents of the computers, tablets, and phones that they seize. The court fight over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, for example, only ended when the FBI paid for a technique to bypass the phones security. Similar hacking techniquesand more warrants for fingerprintsmay become commonplace as the government confronts increasingly secure devices.

Why So Many Smart People Arent Happy
Joe Pinsker
Its a paradox: Shouldnt the most accomplished be well equipped to make choices that maximize life satisfaction?
There are three things, once ones basic needs are satisfied, that academic literature points to as the ingredients for happiness: having meaningful social relationships, being good at whatever it is one spends ones days doing, and having the freedom to make life decisions independently.
But research into happiness has also yielded something a little less obvious: Being better educated, richer, or more accomplished doesnt do much to predict whether someone will be happy. In fact, it might mean someone is less likely to be satisfied with life.
That second finding is the puzzle that Raj Raghunathan, a professor of marketing at The University of Texas at Austins McCombs School of Business, tries to make sense of in his recent book, If Youre So Smart, Why Arent You Happy? Raghunathans writing does fall under the category of self-help (with all of the pep talks and progress worksheets that that entails), but his commitment to scientific research serves as ballast for the genres more glib tendencies.

The Taboo Larry Wilmore Broke
Vann R. Newkirk II
The comedian's n-bomb at the White House Correspondents Dinner highlights a generational shift in black culture.
Georgia McDowell was born the daughter of farmers and teachers in North Carolina in 1902. She was my great-grandmother, and she taught me to read, despite the dementia that clouded her mind and the dyslexia that interrupted mine. I loved Miss Georgia, though she kept as many hard lines in her home as she had in her classrooms. One of the hardest lines was common to many black households: The word nigger and all of its derivatives were strict taboos in person, on television, and on radio from any source, black or otherwise, so long as she lived and breathed. Shed kept the taboo through decades of teaching black students and raising black children. For most of my childhood, the taboo was absolute.

Opting Out of Coastal Madness to Live a Low-Overhead Life
Anne Trubek
For some, abandoning expensive urban centers would be a huge financial relief.
Neal Gabler has been a formative writer for me: His Winchell: Gossip, Power, and the Culture of Celebrity was one of the books that led me to think about leaving scholarship behind and write nonfiction instead, and Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination was the first book I reviewed as a freelance writer. To me, he exemplifies the best mix of intensive archival research and narrative kick.
So reading his recent essay, "The Secret Shame of Middle-Class Americans," was a gut punch: First, I learned about a role model of mine whose talent, in my opinion, should preclude him from financial woes. And, then, I was socked by narcissistic outrage: I, too, struggle with money! I, too, am a failing middle-class American! I, too, am a writer of nonfiction who should be better compensated!

The Secret Shame of Middle-Class Americans
Neal Gabler
Nearly half of Americans would have trouble finding $400 to pay for an emergency. Im one of them.
Since 2013, the Federal Reserve Board has conducted a survey to monitor the financial and economic status of American consumers. Most of the data in the latest survey, frankly, are less than earth-shattering: 49 percent of part-time workers would prefer to work more hours at their current wage; 29 percent of Americans expect to earn a higher income in the coming year; 43 percent of homeowners who have owned their home for at least a year believe its value has increased. But the answer to one question was astonishing. The Fed asked respondents how they would pay for a $400 emergency. The answer: 47 percent of respondents said that either they would cover the expense by borrowing or selling something, or they would not be able to come up with the $400 at all. Four hundred dollars! Who knew?

The Case Against Reality
Amanda Gefter
A professor of cognitive science argues that the world is nothing like the one we experience through our senses.
As we go about our daily lives, we tend to assume that our perceptionssights, sounds, textures, tastesare an accurate portrayal of the real world. Sure, when we stop and think about itor when we find ourselves fooled by a perceptual illusionwe realize with a jolt that what we perceive is never the world directly, but rather our brains best guess at what that world is like, a kind of internal simulation of an external reality. Still, we bank on the fact that our simulation is a reasonably decent one. If it wasnt, wouldnt evolution have weeded us out by now? The true reality might be forever beyond our reach, but surely our senses give us at least an inkling of what its really like.

Human Extinction Isn't That Unlikely
Robinson Meyer
A typical person is more than five times as likely to die in an extinction event as in a car crash, says a new report.
Nuclear war. Climate change. Pandemics that kill tens of millions.
These are the most viable threats to globally organized civilization. Theyre the stuff of nightmares and blockbustersbut unlike sea monsters or zombie viruses, theyre real, part of the calculus that political leaders consider everyday. And according to a new report from the U.K.-based Global Challenges Foundation, theyre much more likely than we might think.
In its annual report on global catastrophic risk, the nonprofit debuted a startling statistic: Across the span of their lives, the average American is more than five times likelier to die during a human-extinction event than in a car crash.
Partly thats because the average person will probably not die in an automobile accident. Every year, one in 9,395 people die in a crash; that translates to about a 0.01 percent chance per year. But that chance compounds over the course of a lifetime. At life-long scales, one in 120 Americans die in an accident.

Friday, August 30, 2013, the day the feckless Barack Obama brought to a premature end Americas reign as the worlds sole indispensable superpoweror, alternatively, the day the sagacious Barack Obama peered into the Middle Eastern abyss and stepped back from the consuming voidbegan with a thundering speech given on Obamas behalf by his secretary of state, John Kerry, in Washington, D.C. The subject of Kerrys uncharacteristically Churchillian remarks, delivered in the Treaty Room at the State Department, was the gassing of civilians by the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad.

Clinton's Battle Plan
Peter Beinart
Dont expect Hillary Clinton to stay above the fray in the general electionher campaign plans sustained and brutal attacks on Donald Trump.
As they look ahead to the general election, some commentators envision a campaign in which Donald Trump attacks viciously and Hillary Clinton makes a virtue of her refusal to stoop to his level. I think Trumps method will be to turn on the insult comedy against Hillary Clinton, declared GOP consultant Mike Murphy earlier this week. Her big judo move is playing the victim. Voxs Ezra Klein speculated earlier this year that Trump sets up Clinton for a much softer and unifying message than shed be able to get away with against a candidate like [Marco] Rubio.
I doubt it will play out that way. Rope-a-dope isnt Clintons style. When facing political threats, her pattern has been to strike firstand with great force.
