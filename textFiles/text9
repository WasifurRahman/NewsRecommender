Forensic scientists with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation used DNA testing to confirm Rusts identity after the remains were found in a part of the county between US 285 and Colorado 17.
The bureau did not release any information about what led investigators to the site and is the lead investigating agency into Rusts disappearance.
His disappearance led to multiple searches via helicopter, horseback and foot in the months after he went missing from his secluded home in the north end of the San Luis Valley.
Authorities found a revolvers grip and Rusts blood-stained fleece near his home.
A motorcycle he had borrowed from a friend turned up near Cotton Creek five weeks after his disappearance.
Rust was inducted into the Marin Museum of Bicyclings Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1991 for his role in helping launch the sport.
He was among the first riding the bikes in the early 1980s and would go on to start Colorado Cyclery in Salida in 1985.
A documentary about his life and disappearance, The Rider and the Wolf, came out in 2015.
