Kylie Jenner in silver Balmain at the Met Gala: budget Kim Kardashian 2.0?
May 03, 2016

Kylie Jenner pulled out all of the stops for her first-ever turn on the Met Gala carpet.
And the result was she looked just like vintage Kim Kardashian.
I do think its weird that Kylie apes Kim so hard, so often.
Kylies Balmain gives off such strong Kim K-vibes, only I guess the point is that Kylie is younger and smaller?
Whatever.
Kim Kardashian 2.0.
Kendall Jenner made a point of NOT wearing Balmain like the rest of her family.
Instead, Kendall chose this Versace.
Which I dont know you guys, I sort of love it?
On another woman, I might not have cared, but this looks amazing on her.
Cindy Crawford briefly posed with Kendall Jenner on the carpet, which would have been really cool if Kendall had been wearing Balmain too.
Cindy decided to go to the Met Gala as part of Balmain Army, and I dont hate this.
Ill say it: I think Olivier Rousteing did a great job putting together the Balmain looks for the Met Gala.
Consistently, the Balmain looks were some of my favorites.
Joan Smalls slayed it in Balmain too, you guys.
Unfortunately, barely anyone took photos of her.

Kylies dress looks like a left over from what the Klan wore to Kanyes event. Joans dress is almost literally the same dress
just with cutouts that Kim and the models wore in the other post. (why repeat that bodice on all these dresses?!) At least Balmain changed it for Cindy and she looks beautiful.
I like that Kendall went outside the box with a good designer. She looked beautiful.

Yeah, it looks like what she wore to the Kanye event and to Gatsby themed bday party for whoever that was in her family. Kendull looks good. I wouldve liked Cindys better without the cutouts.

So many of the dresses looked the same to me, they all started to run together. It was like everyone just said machines? Okay, lets do silver! and then they all called Rousteing. If I had to pick a favorite I would go with Cindy Crawfords, but yeahbe a bit more creative, people.

No need to ask
99.9% of the time, Kylie is a budget version of some other person.

Co-sign all the way. Even her coachella look was a look a random girl on Instagram wore a few weeks before.

I feel it is common for Balmain to use shimmery materials, metalics and a lot of bling, so the odds were already in their favor to pull off great outfits
for this years Met Gala theme.

Agreed kaiser, on anyone else kendalls dress would be budget but she looks amazing.
Its probably not that weird that Kylie dresses so much like kim, when I was about her age trying to figure out my style it was very influenced by a way older sister and I probably dressed like she dressed for longer than I should admit.
She obviously looks up to her.

Or she looks up to her business plan, via their mothers brand strategy.
Kendall on the other hand looks stunning in the Versace.
Appropriate for the themeKendell sometimes seems to be the only Kardashian Machine Robot who seems to be going slightly rogue in a modern manner. Well played, Versace.

Its hard to believe she is only 18 years old.
She looks old and washed up.
In my eyes Kylie is jealous of Kendall but tries to be Kim (ending up loking like Chyna) and Kim is Jealous of Kylie but thinks she has Kendalls body.
Khloe thinks shes hot as hell and also the brightest sister but still wants to be Kim, Kendall and Kylie at once while Kourtney doesnt give a crap.
As a general rule, apart from Kourtney, all the sisters want to be somebody else.

Kendalls dress is completely amazing on her. One of the best looks of the gala to me.

Joan looked stunning, Kendall looked really great, I love the styling. The rest of the Kardshian are so boring, with the usual skin tight Balmain. I was watching the red carpet interviews and I sweat Kylies face doesnt move, its so stiff. Its so sad that an 18 yrs old girl is already looking so plastic.

Kendall looks nice but as usual shes missing that twinkle in her eyes.
And Balmain just SLAYED at this event, they should be proud of themselves. Although some of the dresses were a little repetitive.
Kylie looks like a 45 year old housewife. Why would a teenager do this to their face? Tragic.

I wish Kendall would stand up straight; her terrible posture messes with the lines of the dress.

Take a look at the Joan Smalls picture above.
Elegantly gliding up the stairs.
Now look over her shoulder at Kendall trying to catch her balance before the photos start.
So awkward and unbalanced.
What happened to the prestige of the Met Gala?
Kylie Jenner?
Really?
Wasnt it only a few years ago that Kim was refused an invitation?
Talk about jumping the shark.
Although,
I think that happened last year with all the tacky sheer dresses.
The event is meant to celebrate Fashion;
not destroy and cheapen it.

You are so right about Kendall and Joan Smalls, its a perfect study in contrast!
Unfortunately I think the prestige of the Met Ball has followed the same downward trajectory as Vogue, all thanks to the crass commercialization of Anna Wintour.

I guess I am going to be the lone dissenter on this one. I find that all the Balmain dresses looked terribly boring
silver fish scales, skin tight, been there, done that, blah. The only one I like is Cindys. And Kylies post party pics of her bleeding legs and the bruised feet make me thing that not only were these not particularly pretty to wear but also must have been hella uncomfortable.
I am also in disagreement about the fish net with side cutouts that Kendall wore. But I guess given the amount of fish scale patterns on the RC
this made some weird
sense? But I dont see pretty, I dont see theme and I dont see originality or glamour or anything. Just another way of working a version of the go-away-and-die-already-nude-under-layer trend.

I completely agree. Cindys dress was the only one that didnt look like just another Kardashian re-tread. And Kendall was just dull. Again.

Agreed. I think I would have liked Kendalls dress more without the cutouts. It seemed everybody wore the same exact type of style dress. Kendall, Lily, Taylor, Karlie

By all means, lets dress an 18 year old girl up like a pushing-60 mother of the bride.
And lets not even bother to fit the dress to her properly.
Nobody will notice that the sleeves are too long, right?

Cindy looks amazing.
Love Kylies hair, it looks simple and real and accentuates her face.
Kendall looks great too.
Dont get me wrong, I still loathe the Ks, but they looked pretty decent last night (except Kanyegross).

In that second picture you can really see Kendall Jenners nose job.
Subtle, but its there.
Its weird and quite sad that Kylie Jenner is trying so hard to erase her original self completely.

I think Kylie looked nice, especially hair and makeup. I dont care for this or any other Balmain because I feel like Ive been seeing this mess in the past 3 or 4 seasons, quite repetitive.

Its bad enough Kim and Kanye are there.

Why?
Makes me dislike Goop less.
She was right.
This is a down market affair now.
