Homeless hounds get boost as firms back SNDogs
Updated 9:24pm Monday 2nd May 2016 in
By Eve Buckland
HOMELESS hounds across the town have received a welcome boost thanks to new support from two businesses.
Town business SIRVA, based in Mulberry House, Kembrey Park, have teamed up with charity SNDogs as their charitable partner for the year.
They will take part in a variety of fundraising activities for the charity and hope to raise more than 1,000 during the year.
Claire Stephens, from the charity, said she was delighted with the show of support.
Things are going in the right direction for us and were so pleased that we were selected by SIRVA and John Lewis, it means we help more dogs each year, she said.
Its greatto have the backing of these companies. Its what we need to ensure we can keep doing all of the work we are doing.
John Lewis has nominated SNDogs as one of its chosen charities for the Community Matters Scheme between May and July.
Customers at the store can use a green token to choose how much isdonated to the charity.
In a further piece of good news, SNDogs have rescued two new perfect pooches, black terrier cross Angus and golden lurcher mix Lucy.
Both canine companions were rescued from dog death row at Brinkworth pound after being brought in as strays.
Claire said Angus and Lucy be welcome additions to any home.
Angus, who is around eight, has a lovely temperament and hes brilliant with children of all ages. Hes happy on the lead and knows several basic commands such as sit, wait and paw. He probably wont be able to be around cats
Lucy, who is one, is a very sweet and gentle girl who can be a little timid until she gets to know her surroundings.
"She is a bit nervous with strangers but once she gets to know her surroundings she is very happy.
Formed in 2012, SNDogs was designed to save innocent animals from dog death row and helps stray and pound dogs in the town find loving new homes.
Their network has now expanded to include a pool of 15 pre-vetted foster carers who provide accommodation for dogs in need.
The charity covers all food, training and veterinary bills until a suitable long-term home can be found for them.
