AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Xplore
Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ:XPLR), manufacturer of the world's
broadest range of high-quality rugged tablet computers, announced today
it has secured orders in excess of $1.3 million with a large national
field service and engineering company in the electric utility sector.
The company's field service workers will be using Xplore XSLATE B10
fully rugged tablets to achieve greater efficiency in the repair and
restoration of North America's aging utility infrastructure.
Specifically, the XSLATE B10 tablets will be used for the inspection,
assessment, and repair of wood and steel utility poles, as well as field
surveys and audits. With 90 percent of the utility service provider's
3,000 employees working in the field, Xplore listened to the needs of
the field crews and delivered a solution that exceeds their expectations.
"We have witnessed great success with our rugged tablet solutions in the
electric and telecom utilities industry," said Mark Holleran, president
and chief operating officer for Xplore. "The award-winning XSLATE B10
tablet is ideal for customers seeking to automate all of their field
service applications into a scalable and truly mobile solution. When
actionable information is available in real-time on a single device,
customers benefit from additional financial savings and new
revenue-generating opportunities."
IP65 and MIL-STD-810G rated and featuring a unique set of sealed ports,
the sunlight-readable XSLATE B10 tablet with Wet and Glove Touch data
entry can endure even the most challenging work environments. The tablet
is equipped with Windows 7/8.1/10, Intel Broadwell generation
Core-Series processors, and 8GB Ram for superior performance. Up to 20
hours of operation with hot-swappable second battery option, ultra-fast
4G LTE broadband, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi data access means reliable uptime.
