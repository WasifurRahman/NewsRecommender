MCCAA warning over IKEA furniture range after three
MCCAA warning over IKEA furniture range after three children are crushed to death
Tuesday, 3 May 2016, 13:18
Last update: about 1 hour ago
The Technical Regulations Division within the Malta Competition and Consumers Affairs Authority (MCCAA) notifies consumers that IKEA has issued another warning over a range of furniture after a boy was crushed by a set of drawers from the Malm range. The company issued the warning after three children were killed when drawers and wardrobes fell on them.
The following statement has been released by IKEA with regards to this issue: We wish to emphasise that the best way to prevent tip-over of chests of drawers is to attach products to the wall with the included restraints and hardware per the assembly instructions. IKEA has included restraints with our chest of drawers for decades, and wall attachment is an integral part of the assembly instructions.
The Technical Regulatory Division urges the public who has bought such products to make sure that they are properly attached to the wall as per provided instructions. Though there are no known IKEA representatives in Malta, consumers may still have bought their products, either online or from overseas suppliers.
For further information one can contact the Technical Regulatory Division on 23952000.
