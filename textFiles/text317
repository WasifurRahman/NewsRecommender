MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP)
Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler says he will request a court order to compel Gov. Robert Bentley's testimony on his relationship with a former political aide.
Bentley on Monday was a no-show at Zeigler's office following a summons from the state auditor. Zeigler last month said an obscure piece of state code gives him the power to compel testimony under oath.
Zeigler says he will seek pro bono legal representation or fundraise to pursue the matter in civil court.
Bentley last month acknowledged making inappropriate remarks to a senior female political adviser, who has since resigned. He denies misuse of his office.
In April, Bentley said the Alabama Ethics Commission was the appropriate venue for Zeigler's complaints. His office on Monday had no further comment.
