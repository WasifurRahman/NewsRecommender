Honokaa entrepreneur touts product on Shark Tank

HONOKAA
Years ago, when a 20-something Mai Lieu traveled the world as an accomplished hair stylist, she noticed a particular trend.
It didnt matter where I was, I always had to fix haircuts, the now 40-year-old Lieu said. People were always cutting their own bangs and didnt have time to go to the salon, or moms were always cutting their kids hair and (after a mishap), they didnt have time to fix it. So I thought, Why not invent something that will allow them to do it at home?
That aha moment ultimately gave birth to the CreaClip, Lieus do-it-yourself hair-cutting tool and the first product in her line of beauty tools called CreaProducts.
Lieus since expanded CreaProducts to include a nail-painting device, a tool for eye-shadow application
even a clipper for pets. Online tutorials for her products have racked up millions of views on YouTube, and the CreaClip has been featured on the Rachael Ray Show and the Home Shopping Network.
On Friday, Lieu, a Honokaa resident, is anticipating what she says is her biggest feat yet. Shes set to appear on Shark Tank, an ABC reality TV show in which hopeful entrepreneurs pit their ideas to a panel of self-made business leaders in hope of securing investments.
Lieu cant talk about the shows outcome until after it airs, but she said appearing on Shark Tank has been a dream for several years.
So often, people dont set goals, Lieu said. They stop dreaming. But youve got to set goals and keep the momentum going. I never thought (nine years ago) Id now be on Shark Tank, a national TV show thats huge
and perfect for my products. If I had been doubtful or stopped moving forward, I wouldnt have reached this point.
Lieu still cringes recalling her own bad childhood haircuts. Her family immigrated from Vietnam to Canada when she was a small child. She grew up poor, and was subjected to at-home haircuts by her mother to save money.
My bangs would be so short, Lieu said with a chuckle. I (had) horrible pictures.
Lucky for Lieu, bad hair days are a thing of the past. These days, her highlighted, shoulder-length locks are often styled into elegant barrel curls. And early hardships, she said, have since fueled her incessant drive to achieve success.
In her early 20s, she left for Europe to study at renowned hair academies in the United Kingdom.
Once a stylist, she traveled throughout Asia, Europe and North America doing hair, including the locks of celebrities such as Hawaiian great Don Ho and actresses Amanda Righetti and Lauren Velez. Shes won multiple hair-cutting awards now proudly displayed on a shelf in her new Honokaa studio space and once charged premium prices
up to $2,000 to install a set of hair extensions.
And the CreaClip, which started out as a simple prototype made of paper mache and chicken wire from Home Depot, has also taken off. In 2008, the product was featured on the Home Shopping Network and sold out
5,000 units
within just a few minutes, she said. These days, Lieu sells about 20,000 units through CreaProducts per year.
Now Lieu, who has lived in Hawaii for more than a decade, including the last three years on the Big Island, has several other ventures up her sleeve. Last year, she purchased a 3,000-square-foot building in Honokaa to house her new studio, which she plans to use for filming tutorial videos. And shes also spearheading several other business ventures including a Mexican restaurant and a shaved ice business.
Shes just got this new energy coming into the community, said Paul Takamatsu, a Realtor who helped Lieu purchase the building. Shes young and very committed
its not too often you see young people wanting to come into a smaller community and commit, and I feel shes doing that.
Lieu also gives motivational speeches
she says she enjoys sharing with youth her mantra of striving for success and following dreams. Shes brainstorming new product ideas, including an at-home highlighting device, and is mulling the idea of someday converting the studio into a CreaClip hair salon.
What I say to a lot of people is, when youre doing what you love and youre passionate about it, it just seems like the universe is on your side, she said. Solutions will come to you and things just flow. It doesnt feel like work, because you love what you do.
Lieu is inviting the community to come see the Shark Tank debut at a viewing party Friday in Honokaa. The free event runs 7 to 9 p.m. at the Honokaa Peoples Theatre, 45-3574 Mamane St.
