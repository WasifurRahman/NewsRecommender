What's new in Spring Data Hopper?
Engineering
May 3, 2016
As weve just shipped the GA release of Spring Data release train Hopper, lets take a deeper look at the changes and features that come with the 13 modules on the train. A very fundamental change in the release trains dependencies is the upgrade to Spring Framework 4.2 (currently 4.2.5) as baseline. This is in preparation for the upcoming 4.3 release of the framework. We also took the chance to upgrade our Querydsl integration to 4.x (currently 4.1) which required some breaking changes in very core abstractions. Besides that, Hopper contains quite a few significant major version changes its modules.

What's New In Spring Data Release Gosling?
Engineering
September 4, 2015
Over 300 issues fixed across 12 projects makes it pretty hard to keep track on what has happened since the last release. So heres a more detailed excerpt of some of the new features weve been cooking during the last iteration.
Ad-hoc JPA fetch graphs.
Since the Dijkstra release train we have been able to refer to the named entity graph declared on the entity through the @EntityGraph annotation in JPA-backed repositories. In the example below this forces firstname and lastname to be loaded eagerly, while all others remain lazily loaded.

Whats new in Spring Data Evans?
Engineering
October 15, 2014
Spring Data Release Evans has been around for a while and its more than time to finally introduce you to the latest and greatest features we shipped with it.
Theres a lot to cover since major enhancements have gone into the commons module. Those changes already have made it into some store modules and will go on and sneak their way into others over time, too. All of them are already available for at least Spring Data JPA. That said, lets jump right in.
Advanced support for Java 8
Java8 has now been around for a while and previous Spring Data release trains already added fundamental support for some of those. With the Evans release train we extended the support significantly.

$text $search your Documents with Spring Data MongoDB
Engineering
July 17, 2014
MongoDB officially has offered full text search capabilities since its 2.6 release. The feature ranks among the Top 5 most voted features for the server component and ships in its current version with numerous stemmers and parsers, phrase matching, negation and per field weights. So its about time to give it a little love and share whats cooking in Spring Datas kitchen to support that feature.
For text indexing and searching MongoDB defaults the language to English, normalizing the text by tokenizing, removing common stop words and reducing words to their base. Theres support for several other languages as well.
