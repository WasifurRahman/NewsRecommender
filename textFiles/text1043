UNDER-18
Pagham 1 Rottingdean 0 (aet)
Challenge Cup finalRottingdean tested Lewis Boughton in the Pagham goal but found him in splendid form as he pulled off two fantastic saves in the opening half.
Michael Rogerson found space to drill a rocket of a shot into the net to send the Pagham fans wild and clinch the cup.
James Thurgar was always a threat on Pagham breakaways along with Matt Ryan but the Lion cubs final touch let them down.
With the Pagham full-backs pushing forward it was left to Charlie Selby and MoM Alex Rowland to withstand the pressure.
George Bingham and Ceri Marsh found their touch and this put Rottingdean on the back foot but it was goalless after 90 minutes.Pagham controlled the first half of the extra 30 and in the final minutes, Michael Rogerson found space to drill a rocket of a shot into the net to send the Pagham fans wild and clinch the cup.UNDER-15After winning the cup at Arundel, the scene was set for Felpham Colts under-15s to go on and try to win the double.
They followed the cup triumph with a convincing win over Worthing Town Black but a 1-0 loss to Rangers was a setback.Next, third-placed Rustington Park Youth were beaten 3-0 in a fantastic display featuring some of the best football they have played all season.The final game was at home to Worthing Untied Colts
the match to decide the title. Colts needed a win or draw; Worthing had to win.Worthing had an attack and the ball struck a defenders hand and a penalty was given. Felphams keeper Jake Aylward stood no chance from the spot-kick.Colts stepped up a gear and applied plenty of pressure. With nothing to lose Colts went three at the back and in the next attack, the ball went out wide and with some trickery and great footwork by Ben Sullivan, a cross was tapped in by Rob Peart.
There was 20 minutes to play and Worthing turned up the heat. Felpham needed another goal to feel safe, and the keeper launched a long ball over the top of the defence for strikerCorbin DArcy to run on to.He struck it early with power and it hit the net to make it 2-1. Colts had 13 minutes left and they weathered the storm until the final whistle confirmed they were champions again, with a second successive promotion and a cup to add to their success story.
COLTS: Jake Aylward, Lennon Morris, Alex de Lillis, Ollie Martin, Jack Woodruff, Sam Hawkins, Ben Sullivan, Harry Waters, Tom Woollcott, Ben Griffiths, Luke Yates, Ronald Kardos, Charlie Sixsmith, Corbin DArcy, Rob Peart.UNDER-12Midhurst and Easebourne under-12s have won the Invitation Cup.They won the final 4-0 againat Felpham Colts Youth at Palantine Park, Worthing.Tom Pegg and Archie Largan scored two goals each. M&E: Luke Carver, Oakley Shoesmith, Luke Brockhurst, Isaac Neale, Christie Brennan, Joshua OLeary, Archie Largan, Alfie Kyle, Ryan Nursten, Kieran Edwards, Jude Unwin, Tom Pegg.Avisford Youth 3 Whyke United 4Avisfords final competitive game ended in disappointment as Whyke took all three points to snatch third place in the league from under their noses. Whyke took the lead when Jack Mawson stole in at the far post to fire the ball past Klaudiusz Piasecki. Avisford equalised when Damian Wasowskis corner was tucked home from close range by Hugo James for his first Avisford goal. They scored another before half-time as Charlie Hunter bagged his 22nd of the season. A devastating ten-minute spell at the beginning of the second half from Whyke proved decisive. From 2-1 down, Whyke very quickly found themselves 4-2 up as Avisford were left reeling. Hunter reduced the arrears to 4-3 but Whyke held on as Avisford bowed out with a narrow defeat. AVISFORD: Piasecki, Hall, Nowak, Longley, Wasowski, James, Jones, Brian, Hunter. Subs - Berry, Heppenstall, Copeland, Salter.Avisford Youth are re-forming to become Aldwick Athletic FC. They will be playing 11-a-side football at under-13 level next season.They are looking to expand their existing squad to hopefully run a second team so if you are in school Year 7 or 8 in September 2016, and are interested in joining a friendly team, contact Stuart Longley on 07796 635184 or email stuartmlongley@gmail.com Dont miss out on all the latest breaking sports news where you live.Here are four ways you can be sure youll be among the first to know whats going on.1 Make this website your homepage2 Like our Facebook page at facebook.com/pages/Sport-Sussex3 Follow us on Twitter @SportSussex4 Register with us by clicking on sign in (top right corner).
