YEAH, I PRETTY MUCH START WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE THINGS ARE FAKES NOW:
There Have Been Over
May 3, 2016
HIGHER EDUCATION BUBBLE UPDATE: University admits paying $17,570 for a dining hall table was a mistake.
The University of New Hampshire now acknowledges that spending $17,000 on a custom-made chefs table with LED lights for the campus dining hall was a mistake.
Initially, university officials thought the light-up table would allow the dining staff to interact with students and demonstrate healthy cooking techniques.
But word soon got out about the $17,570 price tag on the 16-seat table, which was installed several weeks ago. The school newspaper wrote about it, and other media outlets picked up on it.
The table costs nearly as much as in-state students pay annually for tuition and fees.
I dont think Ive seen a TV chef with a table that nice, and presumably those shows make money.

"Initially, university officials thought the light-up table would allow the dining staff to interact with students and demonstrate healthy cooking techniques."What a load of horse sh*t!
This is as bad as the excuses we'll get on "green energy" expenditures.

It's a teachable moment.The crime was in getting caught and the reason for the crime was, as others have noted, why not? The money's flowing in and something's got to be done with it. Why not some ludicrous self-indulgence?The lesson being taught is to be clever about hiding such self-indulgences. If you don't get caught there's no crime or, in this case, no public backlash.

The rationalization the school offered for this ludicrous purchase is almost funny.
How many college students go to the cafeteria for a lesson in healthy cooking?
They're there to eat, not to "interact" with the dining staff.
And even if you could find one or two students who actually wanted a healthy cooking demonstration, you certainly wouldn't need a light-up table to show them how it's done.

What makes that a "Chef's Table"? It looks like a fairly normal, but nice, table. If they're paying 17 big ones for it, you'd think they could have kicked in a few bucks for nicer chairs.

Classic example of what's wrong with governmental/state institutions - other people's money.
You never spend it as wisely as your own.
If you don't have to make a profit or justify your performance you have no incentive to improve.

Income inequality is only a social justice issue when dealing with how much business executives are paid.
It does not apply to how much universities spend, nor on how much performers like Beyonce pay their stage crews, nor on how much government overpays for toilet seats, nor on how much politicians are paid for short speeches or in book advances.

OPM - Other people's money.
It's pretty easy to get carried away when it is not coming out of your pocket.
The other issue is that regardless of whether one should buy such a table, the price paid seems way too high.
That's the problem with "custom" anything.
Unless the inlays were marble, that is a very overpriced table.
I've seen custom tables in the $10-$20k range.
This should have been in the lower range.
They should have vetted the process along with the idea.
Who created the specs?
Who bid the construction?
What were the other bids?
I'm very curious.
