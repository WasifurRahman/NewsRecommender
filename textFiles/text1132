Bognors Tone Zone Runners had 18 members taking part in the London Marathon, including four first-timers
Alice Slater, Jacqui Salt, Paul Stevenson and Peter Lomax.
With almost perfect conditions for a marathon, it was the ideal time for a debut. Times are inconsequential for a first marathon, the achievement is completing the course and all four runners did that with ease while absolutely loving the experience.
