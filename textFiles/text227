Russia's control over the internet intensifies
CENSORSHIP: Two recent articles illustrate the degrading situation regarding online free expression in Russia: The Center for International Media Assistances piece details the ways free online speech is threatened in the country, while the Financial Times reported on Russias interest in Chinese website filtering technology.
The ways the Russian government aims to control the internet are manyfold, varying from blacklisting websites and targeting social media platforms to the creation of new legislations that have been used to hand jail sentences to bloggers and activists. Russias right to be forgotten law took effect on January this year, amid fears that it would be abused for political censorship.
Russia is also known for its extensive use of troll armies, who spread pro-government propaganda online and attack Russian governments critics, also in the comments sections of western news sites.
Furthermore, Russia is apparently looking at China as an inspiration on how to control peoples online activity. The Financial Times reported that Russia has expressed interest in Chinese techniques -particularly the countrys digital firewall for filtering websites. This should put increased pressure on foreign companies that operate in Russia to comply with the local legislation.
How national parliamentary elections this September play out will be interesting to see after the last Duma elections in December 2011, massive protests broke out in Russia, with social media sites being used extensively in their organisation.
