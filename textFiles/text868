HP has announced its new Pavilion All-in-One PCs, promising to "bring style and performance to the center of your home".
There are two main variants of the new devices:
Standard bezel with optional touch, and either Full HD (1920x1080px) or Quad HD (2560x1440px) resolution - available in 23.8-inch and 27-inch versions
'Near-zero bezel' with Full HD resolution (and no touch option)
Key features of the new All-in-Ones include:
Intel Pentium or up to 6th Generation Intel Core i7 processor options with optional NVIDIA GT 930A graphics or 7th generation AMD up A10 processor options.
1TB with options up to 3TB for storing photos, files, games and movies. Customers can also choose a hybrid drive options with up to 1TB SSHD.
Memory up to 16GB
Custom audio-tuning from B&O PLAY and dual-front firing speakers for captivating sound for your music and movies dont just listen; let the immersive experience of your all-in-one with Audio by B&O PLAY move you.
Optional Intel RealSense Camera on select models for enhanced security through face authentication with Windows Hello. It also enables gesture control apps to provide new ways to interact with the PC.
On certain models with a 'standard' bezel, the Intel RealSense camera option is available, offering Windows Hello support. On the 23.8-inch models with ultra-thin bezel, HP is offering a Privacy Camera, which it says will "pop up via a spring mechanism when in use and can be pressed in to disable both the camera and microphone as a privacy safeguard."
There's also a wide range of ports available, including USB 3.0 Type C for fast charging, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, HDMI out, LAN, audio jack, and a 3-in-1 media card reader.
You can get an overview of the new HP Pavilion All-in-One PCs in the video below:
HP says that the 27-inch Pavilion All-in-One will be priced from $999.99, with availability from July 3. 23.8-inch models will start at $699.99, and will be available from July 10.
