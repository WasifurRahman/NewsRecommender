During a special meeting Monday afternoon, the Board of Selectmen approved the call for next weeks annual town budget meeting and set the date of the referendum when residents will vote on the $64 million 2016-17 budget.

The proposed budget reflects the finance boards desire to limit the tax increase to 1 mill. The current rate is 21.32 mills, or $21.32 per $1,000 of assessed property value. If voters approve the budget as proposed, the tax rate would go up 0.99 mills to 22.31 mills, an increase of 4.64 percent.
Of the proposed budget, $19.9 million is allocated for general government, $36.2 million for education, $5 million for debt service and $2.8 million for capital improvements.
The proposed budget is a 4.56 percent increase over the current $61.2 million budget.
Copies of the detailed budget are available for residents at the finance department on the second floor of the town hall.
Qualified voters will have the opportunity to vote on the budget on May 17 from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the following three locations:
1st and 3rd Districts
Stonington Fire House, Stonington Borough
2nd District
Pawcatuck Fire Station
4th and 5th Districts
B.F. Hoxie Fire House, Mystic
Absentee ballots will be available from the town clerks office during normal business hours starting on Tuesday, May 10.
