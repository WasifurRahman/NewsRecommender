Peak Design Has a New, Smaller Everyday Messenger Bag
MAY 03, 2016
By Greg Scoblete
When Peak Design launched the Everyday Messenger on Kickstarter last year, it quickly racked up millions in pledges and became the most popular bag in crowdfundings (relatively brief) history. Buoyed by that success, Peak is releasing a more compact version of the bag, the Everyday Messenger 13. The original stays on the market as the Everyday Messenger 15.
The Everyday Messenger 13 will share all the features of the original, except it will have room for a 13-inch laptop in a dedicated pocket and slightly less gear than the originalin this case, a full frame DSLR and up to three lenses.
The bag can expand as you stuff more gear in, growing from 6L to 14L. It was two FlexFold removable interior dividers and a MagLatch to quickly and silently open the front flap. The top of the bag has a zippered opening, allowing you access to the bags contents without flipping the front flap.
There are two Capture clip attachment points for placing cameras and the bag has a 2-inch padded seatbelt-style strap. The exterior is weather resistant and the bag comes with a lifetime warranty.
It will retail for $220 and ships in mid June.
