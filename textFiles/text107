Luckily the horses avoided the local roads, otherwise drivers could have faced closures and tailbacks.
The Bromley officers were assisted by members of the Metropolitan Polices Roads and Transport Policing Command, who were pictured taking the horses for a walk.
Officers appealed for the owners to come forward and call 101, using the reference CAD 2576 24APR16.
Its not the first time officers in Bromley have had to call on their animal handling skills, after runaway pigs managed to close off a main road in Orpington back in December.
PCs Nikki Crocker, Laura Evans and Shaz Bassi with one of the pigs, which escaped onto the A21 in Orpington.
Officers were called out twice in one week to round up the rogue pigs which had wandered on to the A21 between Pratts Bottom and Orpington.
The first call out on December 29 involved a herd of 20 pigs which had broken free from a nearby farm.
The next day another pig from the same farm managed to make a getaway, again ending up on the busy Sevenoaks Road.
