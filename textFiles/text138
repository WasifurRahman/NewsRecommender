How to use GIT checkout
Check that you have Python 2.7 available with command python -V.
In some environments newer (or older, if your distro is on python 3,) python
might be available under another name like python2.7 in which
case you need to use that one instead of plain python.
To start using FlexGet from this directory:
First, install (a recent version of) the virtualenv package to your system.
Now, in your checkout directory, run:
virtualenv .
Or, if you need deluge or transmission libraries from system wide python use:
virtualenv --system-site-packages .
This will initialize python virtualenv. This doesnt need to be directly in
your checkout directory, but these instructions assume thats where it is.
Now use pip from your new virtualenv to install paver, then install flexget
from your checkout dir in editable mode:
bin/pip install paver
bin/pip install -e .
After that FlexGet is usable via <checkout directory>/bin/flexget. Verify
installation by running:
bin/flexget -V
You may place the config file in your checkout directory, or in ~/.flexget
(Unix, Mac OS X) or C:\Documents and Setting\<username>\flexget (Windows).
If you dont want to use virtualenv theres flexget_vanilla.py file which
can be used to run FlexGet without bootstrapping, note that you will need to
install all required dependencies yourself.
