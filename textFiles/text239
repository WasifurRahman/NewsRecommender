New chapter in the battle WhatsApp-courts in Brazil
ENCRYPTION: Starting yesterday afternoon Facebook messaging app Whastapp is blocked for 72 hours in Brazil.The shutdown is reportedly affecting more than 100 million users.The carriers concerned by the order declined to comment so far.
The court ordered the ban to telecom providers in the context of the dispute over access to messages related to a drug investigation that caused in March the arrest of Facebook Vice President for Latin AmericaDiego Dzodan.
Facebooks maintains that it does not hold records of the seized chats, and is therefore unable to give access to the judge.Earlier this month Whatsapp enabled end-to-end encryption by default to all its 1 billion users exchangesaround the world.
The court reacted with an order to cell phone carriers to disable Whatsapp on their services for 72 hours asfrom 2pm yesterday, under threats of considerable fines in case of non-compliance. In the hours following the announcement of the ban the installation of whatsapp competitors in Brazil saw considerable spikes, and they were all treating on twitter.
The carriers concerned are Telefonica Brasil SA, Amrica Mvil SABs Claro, TIM Participaes SA, Oi SA and Nextel Participaes SA
