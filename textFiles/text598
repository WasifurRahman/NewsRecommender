Monroe County residents will head to the polls Tuesday to decide whether to renew a tax levy to pay for educational technology.The .9866 mill renewal would be for five years.It is the only issue on Tuesdays ballot.The millage is being requested by the Monroe County Intermediate School District but would be used in all nine of the countys public school districts
Airport Community Schools, Bedford Public Schools, Dundee Community Schools, Ida Public Schools, Jefferson Schools, Mason Consolidated Schools, Monroe Public Schools, Summerfield Schools and Whiteford Agricultural Schools.ISD Supt. Dr. Stephen McNew said the levy would generate about $266.39 a student, so depending on the previous years school population, the millage could generate $5.4 million a year.The millage is .9866 cent of every $1,000 of taxable value on a home.The money generated by the millage cant be used for expenses other than educational technology.The millage dates back to 1997, when the county schools asked voters for the levy. It was a time when technological advances were gaining a foothold in classrooms and schools were looking for a way to fund the updates they needed to make.Districts have used the money to create portable computer labs, implement electronic grading and attendance software, install wireless infrastructures, purchase iPads and create virtual academies, school officials say.
