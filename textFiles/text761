The biggest reason being that fitness is still not considered a necessity, it's connoted with luxury. On top of that, the taxes amount to a large number making it all the more difficult for the aam janta to indulge in fitness based activities like gymming, swimming, and others. Providing good quality fitness expertise is an expensive task, to say the least. And when you are low on cash, (phew!) it is best considered, ignored.We asked Ashish Gupta, Fitness expert and Director, Gold's Gym, Gurgaon the top five exercises for a full-body workout and this is what he said, "One does not need a complete gym at home to start working out. It is a common excuse that if we have good machinery, then we will feel motivated to work out. Mostly expensive machinery is used to hang clothes after a while. One should start with the most basic exercises, which are great to keep you in shape."Also read: 5 yoga poses to help you keep cool in the summer Gupta added, "The following are five of the most effective yet easy-to-do exercises that you can totally practice in the comfort of your homes."1.
