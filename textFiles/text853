Remains of a body found in the Republic of Ireland may be those of one of 14 people whom the Irish Republican Army killed and secretly buried, the group set up to search for their corpses said.
The Independent Commission of the Location of Victims Remains in its search for the body of Charlie Armstrong have found human remains in Monaghan, the group said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. The recovery is ongoing and the formal identification process will take some time. Irish police were notified of the find, the group said.
Charlie Armstrong was 55 years old when he disappeared in 1981 shortly after leaving his home in Crossmaglen, south Armagh, near the border with Ireland and the victims family blamed the IRA for his disappearance. The ICLVR last year anonymously received information and a map detailing the location of his body.
The IRA is blamed for killing and secretly burying 14 people during its 36-year-long fight to unify Ireland with the counties of Northern Ireland. So far, six of the victims bodies have been found. The IRA in 2005 formally ended its campaign and pledged to pursue its goals peacefully.
Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
