Visitors drum up fun on school's Africa day
Updated 11:31am Tuesday 3rd May 2016 in
By Michael Benke
YOUNGSTERS at Holy Rood Primary School celebrated the variety of African culture last Friday as it held a special international day.
The school was awash with colour as the pupils learnt about dances and music from across the continent.
A special lunch was put on by the schools kitchen team while the parents of the pupils also helped out.
Holy Rood has pupils from a wide variety of backgrounds, which is something the school is keen to make the most of.
Headteacher Tony McAteer said: We always like to celebrate the multi-culturalism within our school as we believe it makes our pupils better global citizens.
Each year we hold five or six days celebrating different parts of the world and on Friday we looked at the various cultures within Africa.
During the day we had a number of activities for the Children. At Upham Road Chiek Diop from Senegal came into the school to teach African drumming and Swindon Dance held African Dance classes in the Queens Drive campus.
As always many of the parents were fantastic in helping out so I want to thank them.
