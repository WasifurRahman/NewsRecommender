European privacy law has potential impact on adblocker bans.
The EU ePrivacy Directive from 2002, known as the Cookie Directive, might sanction the detection of installed adblockers which allows publishers to request sites whitelisting to users. The legal reasoning behind this interpretation is that the law would require express consent for all tracking, not only cookies.
In addition, the simple fact of installing an adblocker would constitute denial of permission from the user to being tracked.
Lobbyist Alexander Hanff is making a name for himself in Europe championing this interpretation, to the point that he announced the imminent launch of a name and shame website for publishers illegally detecting adbockers.
The EU Commission answered Hanff request on the point with an argumentation that concludes: in light of the above article 5.3 (of the ePrivacy Directive) would also apply to the storage by websites of scripts in users terminal equipment to detect if users have installed or are using adblockers.
Legal commentators are far from reaching a consent on the point, defined a techno-juridic trickery byEmmanuel Parody, secretary general ofFrench online publishing trade body GESTE, which recently convinced several major French newspapers to run a trial ad-blocker ban for a week.
