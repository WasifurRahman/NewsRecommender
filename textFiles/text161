Eloctate and Alprolix had combined revenue of $640 million for the year ended March 31.John Cox, Biogen's current executive vice president of pharmaceutical operations and technology, will serve as CEO of the new company.The new company, which is expected to be based in the Boston area, will be named at a later date.
