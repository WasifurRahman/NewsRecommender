NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A Kenyan hospital official says a child estimated to be seven months old has been rescued from the rubble of a building that collapsed three and half days ago.
Simon Ithae, spokesman of the Kenyatta National hospital, says the baby was pulled from the rubble of the seven-story building at 4 a.m. local time. Ithae said the baby had no physical injuries and is being treated for dehydration.
The death toll from the collapsed building now stands at 23, according to police, and the Kenya Red Cross says that 93 people have been reported missing.
Taking advantage of a high demand for housing in Nairobi, some property developers bypass building regulations to cut costs and maximize profits.
