Lady Gaga & Kate Hudson do Versace for the Met Gala: terrible or fun?

Fashion, Kate Hudson, Lady Gaga, Met Gala
There was a notable lack of Versace on the red carpet at the Met Gala last night.
Part of that is cyclical
Versace, as a fashion house, has been on the down-swing for several years.
Part of it is by design though, as in Donatella Versace only wanted to dress a handful of women.
I dont know if Donatella wanted to dress Kendall Jenner, but thats the way it happened.
I kind of think Donatella only meant to dress Kate Hudson and Lady Gaga.
Gaga and Kate posed together on the carpet and I think were meant to compare and contrast and treat these two looks as part of the same theme.
So whats the theme?
Robot bride and groom?
Theme: looking terrible.
Is it weird that Kate Hudsons Versace is more offensive to me than whatever Gaga has going on?
I mean, we expect this sort of nonsense from Gaga.
She can clean herself up and pretend to be mainstream for a few months, but eventually the Old Gaga will come out and shell be staggering around a red carpet in her bedazzled panties.
Kate Hudson KNOWS BETTER than this.
Kate Hudson should have just said no to this origami bridal nightmare.
Also: I hope to God thats a wig on Gaga.
I hope she didnt honestly do that to her hair, although who makes a wig that looks like that?
Its like Joan Cusack-in-Working-Girl style.

Yeah, with a skirt or a pair of pants the outfit would have been good!

Gaga really needs to stop messing with her hair, the hairline is becoming a disaster.

How does Gaga walk in those shoes?
Does she have great balance or do her assistants carry her around?

While I like what Gaga is rocking here, I dont think it goes with this venue.
The Grammys perhaps?
I would love to see her do something more traditional, but a Gaga twist at something like this.

The detail on Gagas outfit is beautiful, but the problem is the bottom half or lack thereof.
Shes worn a dance outfit a million times with her clunky shoes, so its just another day for Gaga.
The hair is a disaster.
It is so 80s.
I adore Kates and she looks fantastic.
I thought it went with the theme, didnt it?
Im unsure. I think I understand the theme, but then I dont get it a lot on many of the outfits, where they even followed it at all.

I also love Kates look and I think it went with the theme. I have no nice words to say about Lady gaga so Im not going to say anything at all.

How in the world do you make Kate Hudson look a bit heavy?! This dress did it, from the side it looks terrible.
There are no words for Lady Gagas mess.

Gaga looks bad in a bad way. She looks like an extra from Beyond Thunderdome

Kate Hudsons Snapchat makes me hate my life. It also makes me wonder when she ever sees her kids, shes never home. This dress looks like shes in another one of her bad romcoms. Not her best.

Lady Gagas look is a bit too rock n roll, but at least it looks more futuristic than Kates look. I think Gaga should have chose a different wig/make-up.

Gagas jacket kinda looks like a motherboard circuit, which is cool.
It seems Kates dress is made from sewingpattern parts, so an hommage to construction, which is a nice idea, but the execution is poor.
the general looks arent very strong enough.
