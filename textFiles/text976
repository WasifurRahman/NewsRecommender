Cyclist's honour ride for Dorothy House
Updated 10:15am Tuesday 3rd May 2016 in
By Tanya Yilmaz, Trowbridge and Melksham reporter
AN intrepid cyclist whose mother-in-law was cared for by Dorothy House will be taking on a mammoth challenge this month by cycling from coast to coast in America.
Ian Carey, who lives in Hampshire lost his mother-in-law Dorothy to cancer in October 2013 and since then has pledged to raise funds for the Winsley-based charity.
The 58-year-old said: I vowed that one day I would do something to repay them for the care and support they provided to us in those last few weeks and the American dream I had years previously flickered once again.
I could not have contemplated this challenge without the love of my wife and son, nor would it seem right to consider doing it without trying to raise some funds for charity and I have therefore chosen to ride in memory of my mother-in-law and for Dorothy House. Whilst my mother-in-law was 82 when she died, at the other end of the cycle of life there are young children with life-threatening illnesses and I would like to ride for them too."
Therefore, Naomi House will be my second charity and I hope I can do something for both of these to help with the wonderful work they do to alleviate pain and suffering. Knowing that each mile on my 3,500 mile journey will be raising much needed funds will drive me on and will also be a reminder that the pain and suffering I will no doubt experience during my journey is nothing to the pain and suffering of losing a loved one at no matter what age of life.
Mr Carey will take part in the CrossRoads Cycling Adventures on May 8 and the coast to coast cycle will take seven weeks, covering 3,500 miles. To donate, visit virginmoneygiving.com/usacoast2coast.
