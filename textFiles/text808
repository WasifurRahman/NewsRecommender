Expert realtors and professional appraisers dealing in Irvine homes for sale agree that there are many big and small things one needs to do before putting up their property for sale. These things add value to the overall property, leading to a magnanimous increase in the profits.Here is a list of 20 sure ways that improve the value of your home.
1. Focus and Fix the StructureFirst and foremost, it is important to fix the basic fixtures like leaking roofs, dampness in the walls or roof. Check the joists and roof timbers for any kind of rotting. Also investigate any infestations and broken tiles etc.Although these repairs are expensive but they add immense sale value to your property.
2. Maintain Central Heating systemUsually, the Irvine homes for sale are equipped with central heating systems, but in case you dont have it, then it is worth investing in one. Installing or updating a central heating system always brings more value than its cost. 3. Update PlumbingIt is essential for you to investigate all the old pipes and plumbing in the house. You may not be having a problem now but on inspection; these problems may come forward, like a bursting pipe, etc. Check the hot and cold water pressures, your boiler and everything else.4. Electricity ServicesCheck all the electrical boards and fuses, etc. If there are any lose wiring, then attend to them. Add some extra sockets and some modern switchboards can add a lot of value. If you think you need to rewire the whole house, then also add whatever other accessories that are necessary as well.
5. Fix All External DefectsSmall defects can make a big difference in the value of your property if they are combined together. Peeling paint, squeaking or sticking doors and windows, jammed door latches, moldy nooks and crannies in the kitchen and bathroom, sewer or pet smells, cracks, deteriorating plaster and squeaky doors, floors and stairs are big value buffers. They can bring down the overall price of your house. These repairs can be made on your own and you dont need an extravagant budget to do so.
6. Refurbish or Replace WindowsIf your windows need refurbishing or need to be replaced, then do it. The windows play a very important part in the beauty of a house as well as being a necessity. It has been observed that Irvine homes for sale with upscaled windows and shutters bring more dollars compared to the ones which are outdated. Examine the panes and glasses and assess what needs to be done. Let the sun shine through your beautiful windows.7. Enhance the Curb AppealRemember the clich, First Impression is the Last Impression. For many buyers, this clich works. They can fall in love or instantly dislike a house based on its exterior. An attractive and neat curb area will get you good buyers, add value to your property and sell it quickly. Fix the brickwork, attend to the hanging gutters, and freshen the paint on the exterior. Trim the bushes and trees blocking the sunlight. Give a makeover to your garden/yard, walls and add some color to it. Plant some tulips near the windows. Some pansies would look nice near your mailbox and a brightly colored garden bench would perfectly complete the whole look.
