Countryside Hounslow consultation
Posted on 29th April 2016 by lookwestlondon
Countryside Properties are consulting on their plans to expand a primary school and build more than 280 new homes in Hounslow.
The plans for the 6.6 acre site between London Road and Pears Road would produce 284 new homes, 40% of which would be affordable, while expanding the school from three to five form entry.
Countryside were chosen as preferred partner by Hounslow Council earlier in 2016.
