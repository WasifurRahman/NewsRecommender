ALMOST ONE MONTH after their case against the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) was adjourned pending a ruling, Christ Church West MP Dr Maria Agard and her attorney, Hal Gollop QC, are still awaiting word on when a decision will be handed down.

Court Option

On the last occasion on April 8, when the matter was heard before Justice Olson Alleyne in the Supreme Court, he adjourned it.
Gollop told the DAILY NATION yesterday morning they were still awaiting word on when a decision would be returned.
I would not be able to say when that will be, as the court has to make that decision. When that time has come they will notify us and we will return to court, he said.
On that last occasion, Queens Counsel Elliott Mottley, Roger Forde and Leslie Haynes, representing the BLP, sought to have the case dismissed on the grounds that it was incorrectly lodged with the court in the first place.
Agard filed the action after she was expelled from the party last November 22.
The dentist is contesting the fairness and legitimacy of the decision by the partys National Council to expel her. (RB)
