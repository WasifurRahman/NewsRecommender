While Nayantara dropped out due to lack of call sheets, Kajal hasn't showed interest because of the pay packet offered to her. And then Ileana rejected the role citing that she will be playing a more mature role which she don't want to. With all these hot ladies ruled out, and other newcomers like Tamanna and Rakul Preet not a perfect match for Balayya, director Krish has intensified the hunt for Gautamiputra Satakarni's leading lady. Though Balayya is advising Krish to find out a new lady, our director is said to be interested only in big starlets. We hear that they are approaching Shruti Haasan now.
