Emerson considers ways to cut spending												Featured

Emerson City Council, facing a glut of needed repairs, but with nowhere near enough cash to hire the needed manpower, may turn to prison power to solve its problems.
We have talked in the past about beautifying the city, especially along the 293 corridor, City Manager Kevin McBurnett told the council at a called work session. But the fact is, we have more work than we have employees. Our public works department, which includes one supervisor and four employees, acts as the building maintenance department, the roads department, the water and sewer department and the refuse department.
McBurnett said he had been looking for ways to increase the staff when he came across a possible solution.
For several years now, McBurnett said. Cartersville has contracted three work crews from the Floyd County prison system. The crews include a certified correctional officer and up to eight inmates working 40 hours a week."
The correctional officer takes work orders from the city and makes sure the work is carried out.
But its not cheap.
One crew costs $63,230 a year, McBurnett said. But thats a lot cheaper than hiring employees to do the work.
In other financial reports, McBurnett proposed an annual budget that falls short of last years by about -.6 percent.
But there is a light on the horizon and its not Motel 6.
The City of Emerson adopted a resolution requesting the General Assembly approve a hotel/motel tax hike from 5 percent to 8 percent, McBurnett said, It passed and as soon as the governor signs it, we will begin seeing a lot more in our coffers.
The revenue stream generated by the tax increase is almost tripled
from $6,706 last year to more than $126,000 this year.
In other business, the council approved a resolution to buy a sign for the city hall complex.
This will be a double faced sign and housing with LED lighting plus a dedicated computer and software, McBurnett said. This sign looks more like a tv screen than one of those old red-dot signs. It looks almost like one of those new scoreboards at a stadium.
Council also approved the sale of a surplus 2006 Elgin street sweeper.
We have determined that it is cheaper to contract the street sweeping than do it ourselves, McBurnett said.
Emerson City Council will meet next on May 9 at 7 p.m. at Emerson City Hall.
