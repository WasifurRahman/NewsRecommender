Primary school pupils hit all the right notes with debut pop album
Updated 9:43am Tuesday 3rd May 2016 in
By Eve Buckland
RECORDING your debut album in primary school may seem like an impossible dream for some but it was one that came true for 200 pupils last week.
Children at Ashton Keynes Church of England Primary School sang their hearts out as part of the iSing POP project, which gives youngsters the opportunity to learn and record an album in one week.
The children, aged between 4-11, put on polished performances for a seven track album filled with empowering and positive lyrics designed to inspire them.
The team from iSing visited the school for a week-long recording session, and to teach children the inner workings of a recording studio.
As part of the slick production engineers professionally mixed the album and taught the children a series of carefully choreographed dance moves.
And the performances struck all the right notes for head teacher Samantha Saville.
I didnt think I could be any more proud of my students and I am so happy they have enjoyed the week. It has made everyone really happy, even the dinner ladies have been singing along, she said.
We are a singing school anyway, singing brings out the best in students, it gives them confidence and a chance to express themselves.
Ive seen some children who are born performers so we may be seeing them as recording artists in the future.
Mrs Saville said the children hoped to unite the community through the positive songs.
We want to reach out into the community and inspire others with the singing, the album and the concert she said.
It was a really professional set-up, and my favourite song was show me the way, which is all about guidance which is one of our key values.
The parents have been really excited about hearing their children sing, theres just been a great atmosphere all week because it is something unique and different.
The children will take to the stage at Holy Cross Church on Wednesday (MAY 4) for a glittering concert performing all seven songs to an audience of more than 100 people. Performances will take place at 2pm and 6pm.
The team behind iSing have more than 20 years experience managing and producing music for bands and schools teams.
iSingPOP gives primary school children the chance to record pop songs with positive lyrics, aimed at promoting self-worth. The project engages children and their families and offers school the opportunity to work with the local community.
If you want to buy tickets to the performance call Ashton Keynes on 01285 861436 or buy on the door.
