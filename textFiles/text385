Hi there,
This lib looks great. I need to use it as a static lib in a 64 bit windows and 64 bit OSX project. Is this possible?
I have not been able to compile it yet (trying OSX first). I checked out the cpp and c git hub repos. I set the path to the c header files with export PAHO_C_HEADERS=xxx. I was then getting errors that it couldnt find malloc() so added these lines to the top of client_persistence.cpp:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
now when I run make I get:
ld: unknown option: -soname
Any advice? Im not that savvy with makefiles.
Cheers,
Nay.
