Push for tougher stance on non-compliance relating to water use in OTOP

Orari Temuka Opihi Pareora water zone committee members are pushing for a tougher stance to be taken with non-compliance related to water consents.
Environment Canterbury is vowing a more vigilant approach to enforcing compliance with water consents in the Canterbury region.Figures show 16 per centof monitored ground and surface water incidents in the Orari Temuka Opihi Pareora (OTOP) water zone were significantly non-compliant between July 2014 and June 2015.While 54 out of 333 incidents were non-compliant,just three abatement notices were issued by ECan, and no infringement notices-numbers which surprised zone committee members at an OTOP meeting on Monday.ECanprincipal resource management adviser for complianceRichard Purdonsaid: "We've heard the message loud and clear that we need to be more vigilant when it comes to enforcement with water."Purdon said there were actions in place that would bring OTOP into compliance. This would entail phone calls, letters and as well as a follow up process."If they refuse to progress we will take enforcement action."ECan southern zones manager Michael Hide described 54 as a "pretty big chunk"."There's some reasonably high non-compliance numbers in here ... and enforcement action is relatively low at this point because people are still adjusting to this slightly different operating environment."Hide said the high number could be because of landowners having only recently installed water meters, and having only had them monitored for the first time.He expected this number would drop once any kinks were ironed out between the landowner, the meter and the monitor.

Farmers taking more than 10 litres per second have been required under nationwide regulations to have a water metre since November 2014.As a result of the disappointingdatacollected in Canterbury, ECan in coming weeks will contact 600 landowners about their meter status.Purdon said there were landowners who did not have a meter installed yetand landowners who had yet to have their meter verified.At the meeting ECan representative David Caygill said: "In relation to the 54 occasions where people were significantly non-compliant, there were three abatement notices issued but no infringement notices. I guess I'm a bit surprised by that."Hide said that was a fair comment which had been echoed across all the zones.Committee member Ad Sintenie said the committee had heard before that things were going to get tougher for non-compliance."We heard exactly that last year, and the year before ... what will really happen? I'm very disappointed to hear it."Sintenie suggested if he drove at 120kmh down a motorway he would expect to lose his licence if caught, and consequences should be taken seriously for those not complying.Hide said over alldata showed of the 2662 consents within the zone, 661 were monitored.Hide told the committee there were 114 monitoring incidents relating to industrial discharges. Of those, there was 19 minor non-compliance issues and three significant non-compliance issues. No enforcement action was taken at any of the incidents.The committee also heard there was 153 agricultural discharge incidents monitored. Of them there was 71 minor non-compliance, six significant non-compliance, and three forms of enforcement action taken (two abatement notices and one infringement notice).Hide said there had been 631 complaints made within theOTOP zone, the second highest number after the Christchurch-West Melton zone.Of those complaints, 62 per cent were about odour and smoky chimneys.
