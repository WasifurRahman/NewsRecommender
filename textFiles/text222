The Met Gala 2016: the dull, the terrifying and the brilliantly odd
The Met Ball is, to paraphraseMean Girls,the one night a year when celebs can dress like total freaks and no one can say anything about it.

For those unfamiliar with the Met Gala, its basically a cross between a glossy red carpet affair and a fancy dress party: the themed prom of your dreams. Hosted by Vogue at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it is, to paraphrase Mean Girls, the one night a year when celebs can dress like total freaks and no one can say anything about it. Each year there is a theme to match the The Costume Institutes spring exhibition the only rules are stick with it, be bizarre, outlandish and remember that theres no such thing as over the top.
This years theme was Manus xMachina: Fashion In An Age Of Technology. A man-meets-machine theme surely offers a world of endless possibilities: suits that move by themselves! Colour-changing gowns! Holographic ties! Levitating shoes! Floppy disk trains!
Or everybody could just come in silver, I guess.
The cardinal offence of the Met Ball is to be boring, and thisyear, almost nobody was free from sin. As Miranda Priestly would say: Metallics for a technology theme? Groundbreaking.Cindy Crawford, Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian (both in Balmain, like always), Rita Ora and Taylor Momsen (wait, I mean Swift) all need to take along hard look at themselves.
The only thing worse than Ill just shove something shiny on is Mmmmm guess Ill ignore the theme altogether and make sure I look nice. Flagrant disobedience never looked so miserably bland. In this category: Amber Heard, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Uma Thurman, everyone in Topshop, and literally ALL THE MEN. I mean, Tom Hiddleston could be any human male at a posh event from 1858-now.
In contrast, plus points for arbitrary weirdness go to Sarah Jessica Parker for coming as some sort of virginial pirate, Lorde for her directional arm cast, Zayn for his directional arm plates, Katy Perry for her noble ensemble reminding us all of the importance of tech security (keep it under lock and key, folks!), Lady Gaga for coming as a sexy microchip, andwill.i.am for whatever that is.
The best theme interpretations in my mind go to Allison Williams for her actually beautiful 3D-printed gown, Emma Watson for her outfit made entirely out of recycled bottles, Claire Danes for coming as a Disney light-up princess doll, FKA Twigs for dressing as a dystopian leader from the future, and Orlando Bloom for coming in a boring normal suit and just pinning an actual tamagotchi on his lapel. Baller move.
The best outfits of all were even weirder. Beyonc couldnt be outdone in this dress, seemingly made out of the skin of her husbands mistress: as she warned us she would do on Lemonade, with the lyric If its what you truly want, I can wear her skin over mine. Of course this peach PVC number is also studded with pearls reportedly worth around $8,000 each.
Solange shone like the sun in this bright yellow structural creature (paired with some slick yellow leggings that nod to her sisters outfit) proving yet again that she is the only woman on earth who can pull off looking like a cubist painting.
Kanye was possibly the only person to have ever worn ripped jeans to a fashion event hosted by Anna Wintour and the Met, studding a jean jacket to oblivion, and wearing pale blue contacts to boot- he and FKA Twigs could lead the dystopian future together. When asked about his icy eyes, Kanye simply replied, Vibes.
But my personal favourite of the night has to be Lupita Nyongo, who, radiant as ever, wins points for being on theme in her afrofuturistic look and the technology behind her outfit (her dress is sustainably made by Calvin Klein for The Green Carpet Challenge). She looksabsolutely stunning, and is as far from boring as its possible to be with two-foot-tall hair. Perfection.

ReadingWhat Is Not Yours Is Not Yoursis like settling into a roller coaster.

Gepetta walks into a classroom in is your blood as red as this? (yes), a story at the heart of Helen Oyeyemis first collection of tales. And, yes, her name looks familiar: a feminised slant on the creator of Pinocchio in Carlo Collodis 19th-century novel. Sure enough, the subject of the class is the history of puppetry; Gepetta is struck by the presence of Rowan Wayland, already settled in the room. There is an ocean of space around him; he seems to be either a pariah or a celebrity, maybe both. Gepetta cant take her eyes off him. Rowans physical effect
godlike jawline, long-lashed eyes, umber skin, rakish quiff of hair
is that ofa lightning strike. An inhuman beauty, one might say, and with good reason, for it becomes apparent that Rowan is a puppet, too, masterless and entirely alive.
It is a mark of Oyeyemis confidence that she masters such shifts so adeptly
but at the age of just 31 she is an experienced writer. Her first novel, The Icarus Girl, was written while she was still at school; she has since published four more, all of them built from a love of language and a fascination with fairy tales and mythology which have earned her comparisons with Angela Carter and there are moments in this collection, certainly, which recall The Bloody Chamber. On the surface, Oyeyemis dornika and the st martins day goose looks like a riff on Red Riding Hood, an answer to Carters Company of Wolves, when Dornika meets a wolf on a mountain. Once again, however, things are not as they seem: . . . lets try to speak of things as they are: it was not a wolf she met but something that had recently consumed a wolf. And Dornika is not a little girl but an adult; the story draws not only on what is familiar to us in western Europe but also the tales of the Czech poet Karel Jaromr Erben
it takes its epigraph from his ballad The Golden Spinning Wheel, agruesome slant on a Cinderella tale.
Despite all these influences, the story is absolutely Oyeyemis own, set in a world where speaking of things as they are might lead the reader in any direction at all. And her arguments, about identity, about sexuality, are more fluid than Carters, as is to be expected from a writer of her generation and with her history. Born in Nigeria, Oyeyemi has lived in the UK since the age of four. Writers with a foot in two places often have a keen sense of what it means tobelong
or not to belong.
She plays with this idea most directly in a brief history of the homely wench society, in which a group of young women push down the doors of an all-male society at Cambridge University (the authors alma mater; I reckon she knows whereof she speaks). What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is freighted with ideas of entry, of permission: it is a book full of locks and keys. Intheopening story, books and roses, a foundling is left in a chapel; the little girl has a golden chain around her neck, and on the chain is a key. As she grows, the girl tries every lock, but no doors open. ...what could she call it, a notion, a suggestion, a promise? She will discover that the key fitsthe door of a library that smells of leather and roses.
But the path to the door is not direct: like most of the tales in this book, books and roses loops and swirls, hooking characters together and then setting them apart, making the reader wait until the next story (or perhaps the one after that) to meet up with them again. Do not be misled by this recurrence; the stories here are linked not by a thread of events, but by a sensibility, one cut free from the constraints of conventional narrative. The tales swerving trajectory makes their peaks of emotion
as when a character in presence imagines the life of the child she has never had
all the more powerful. Reading What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is like settling into a roller coaster: you must abandon yourself to the turns and drops. Only then will you enjoy the ride.
What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours byHelen Oyeyemi is published byPicador (263pp, 14.99)
