New Accessible Technology Section Added to ADA.gov
May 3, 2016
The U.S. Department of Justice has launched anew Accessible Technology sectionfor ADA.gov, its Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Web site, to further assist covered entities and people with disabilities to understand how the ADA applies to certain technologies, such as Web sites, electronic book readers, online courses, and point-of-sale devices. Covered entities have longstanding obligations to make their programs, goods, services, and activities accessible-including those they provide online or via other technology. The new Web pages compile in one place the Department's technical assistance and guidance about accessible technology, as well as information about the Department's accessible technology enforcement efforts, regulation development, and other federal accessible technology resources and initiatives.
To find out more about the ADA, visit the Pacific ADA Center's website atwww.adapacific.org, or call us at 1-800-949-4232 (V/TTY).
