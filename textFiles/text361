Lupita Nyongo in Calvin Klein at the Met Gala: amazing or budget?

Lupita Nyongo has done the Met Gala carpet before, to mixed results.
Lupita seems to view the Met Gala as an opportunity to do weird/unconventional/amazing things, and last night was no different.
She chose a simple enough Calvin Klein gown in a liquid green, a shade of which I can only describe as metallic seaweed.
The color works on Lupita, the cut works on her, and the dress itself is fine.
But Lupita dared to do something unique with the styling: a giant hairpiece that gave her at least a foot and a half of giant hair.
I dont know I sort of like it?
Emma Watson and Margot Robbie were the other Calvin Klein girls at last nights Met Gala.
Margot is the next big thing, and shes probably going to be a major star when The Suicide Squad is released.
Is this what the next big thing should wear?
No.
This is a nothing dress.
Its too minimalist and too clean.
She looks like she didnt try at any level.
As for Emmas dress, it was made from entirely recycled materials.
While I appreciate that she was doing something different and new, the actual dress and design is super-boring.

I love Lupitas hair. I hate the dress. The cut is ugly, the colour is ugly, the material is ugly, everythig is ugly.
Its more suited for an aging show girl.
I like that Emma followed the theme and used recycled materials, but I dont like the dress.
Margot looks boring.

Lupita wins. The hair was a risk, but she looks great and definitely stood out. Also I want her arms.

Liked everything about Lupitas look and Emmas eco-fashion was one of the few that actually embraced the real theme. Margot never does it for me even though she is beautiful, and happening, and all that. I know Im supposed to be bowled over, but I am not.

Love Lupita in general, but the hair is much too Cindy Lou Who for my tastes.

I thought Watson looked stunning, like a 21st century Sargent painting. And she looked mature without looking like a matron or Real Housewife.
Robbies look is boring and unflattering. Cut outs rarely work.
Love Lupitas hair.

Emmas was one of my favorite looks of the night. I dont think the pics in this post really show all the elements of the dress. The train and slight deconstruction of the skirt overlay worked and modernized a classic look. Plus I am pretty sure those are pants underneath it all. Plus you could tell she felt great in it. Win for me.
Lupita look lovely and the train did look like water flowing behind her. Great color for her.

Lupita makes everyone else look like trash, as per usual.
Emmas is okay. Shes a really pretty girl but her style is so boring.
Pass on Margot. I used to kind of like her but she doesnt know how to dress for her body type and always shows up looking like the woman from My Name is Earl. No charisma.

I love her hair, so different and fun! I wish mine could be styled this way even though I dont have any costume galas to attend and it would garner to much attention.

Loved Lupitas hair, but are we really goving her a pass on another pastel, lowcut CK dress? Yawn.
Emma looks great as always, but I like the story behind her gown.
