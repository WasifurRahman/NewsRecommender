Nathan Research: EXPLORING THE WORLD OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ON THE CLOUD

A good cup of coffee from Starbucks can
elevate the whole coffee experience
from just a beverage ritual. But,
the journey from 'bean to cup' is
complicated than what meets the eye. The brand
has a well-run supply chain to ensure that a barista
pours a good cup of Starbucks coffee, and other
products are sourced from superior quality suppliers
before delivering them at the outlets. To lure in
customers, these cafes offer a slew of options-
from easy access to cloud-hosted contextual
content, to mobile apps that allow them to order onthe-
go and notifications on order completion. These
technology-aided preferences increase overall
efficiency and decrease customer wait-time.
Through a wide variety of such option to choose
from-including the mobile, cloud, and big data-
consumers are bestowed with multifarious domainspecific
solutions, such as supply chain and retail.
The advancements are leading businesses to adopt
different business models in their companies. But it
is expanding the gap between what the technology
world is offering and what the enterprise can
execute. "It is not just our vision and ideas, but
more importantly our focused execution that has
shown enterprises how they can reap practical
benefits from our models and solutions," states
Ram Viswanathan, President and CEO, Nathan
Research. The company, through deep domain
knowledge and extensive research understands
the workflows and technologies in enterprises and
creates domain-specific software products. With
the help of the software - all of it on the cloud,
businesses are able to drive lead flow, optimize
marketing channels, increase conversions, grow
sales, fulfill efficiently, and make decisions. "In
several mythologies, Nathan means the creator and
our idea was to create something from nothing, we
aimed at creating solutions and values from abstract
concepts through research," extols Viswanathan.
The firm's solutions are easy to deploy and are
delivered either on-demand or on the cloud.
Marketing, Sales, and Operations managers in
leading Fortune 500 companies use the software on
a daily basis.
ReMAPping Operations and Analytics for Retail
Retail data paired with analytics can assist retailers
in understanding and responding with actionable
insights to the disrupted landscape and changing
ustomer expectations. It helps in
finding new and faster ways to identify
product and channel preferences, engage
and serve consumers in an always-on,
tech-addicted world. Nathan Research's
ReMAP, a web-based portfolio of
solutions is a perfect example of a
management and analytics platform
covering all aspects of operations in a
retail service.
The Lead Management System
(LMS), from Nathan Research's
portfolio is software that can be
configured to handle various types of
demand signals-from online media to
brick and mortar channels. "We have
a call center solution with the help of
which we handle leads and demand
signals and optimize channels," explains
Viswanathan. The initial consultation
or interaction that takes place over the
phone at the call center leads to the next
step where an appointment is set for
follow-up sales calls. The interaction
happens through a scripted workflow
in the lead management module. Users
can manage digital content to set the
right expectations, generate sales leads,
and create effective campaigns in the
Digital Marketing module. Once the
prospect is well understood, the leads are
transferred to field sales as is the practice
in several retail service industries. Field
sales professionals help the customers
in navigating through complex projects
or products where they combine and
configure multiple items seamlessly
and interactively through the Sales
Management module (SMS).This
module also aids them to configure the
price and close the sales of a make-toorder
project or service. Another module
handles Fulfillment Management
(FMS)-to help co-ordinate, and
orchestrate the flow of materials in such
a way that it all comes in correctly-
the labor is scheduled at the right time
and a back-end job flow sequence
is maintained. Different entities in
the supply chain-service providers,
material vendors, and installers have
visibility of their own portals. Typical
examples are home improvement
services, telecommunication services,
and construction services. The firm's
integrated e-business framework
including Product & Catalog
Management, Storefront, e-fulfillment
has found appeal among several e-tailers
as well. Yet another module FTZ (the
Foreign Trade Zone management)
handles the unique workflows involving
processes in an FTZ for importers.
The analytics platform helps slice and
dice data across demand channels,
different supply channels, geographies,
different products, as well as track key
performance metrics for daily decisionmaking
through operational dashboards.
The firm applies data science and deep
learning techniques for their analytics
offerings, to detect shifting trends in
customer segments, lifetime values, and
operational issues.
In one instance where Nathan
Research worked with a customer to
establish a complete workflow from
leads to sales to fulfillment using their
platform. The customer had a complex
workflow which was affecting their
sales and operations. Nathan Research
understood the workflow of the client
and configured a solution using the
ReMAP platform, as a result of which
the customer was able to address the
demand and capacity issues, increase
lead flow and conversions, optimize
pricing, grow sales by 25 percent,
reduce the cycle time by more than ten
days and increase customer satisfaction
by several index points.
Reaching the Destination
"My employees are my extended
family," says Viswanathan, who
carefully handpicked the initial team
and still spends a lot of time mentoring
and coaching employees and empowers
them. He also mentions that "I have
become friends with and it is a honor
to be a trusted advisor to some of my
key customers and strive to understand
the goals and objectives that drive
them and see how we can contribute
to their success." Building such trusted
relationships with customers, and
focused execution are some of the things
driving the success of Nathan Research.
Viswanathan is also active in the Dallas
Entrepreneurial Community, and chairs
a young entrepreneur program called
TiE Young Entrepreneurs (TYE). It is
a program aimed at high school kids
for a couple of hours every Sunday
over a period of ten weeks. It helps
the kids in idea generation, planning,
selling, financing, launching ventures
and culminates in a pitch event. The 25-
30 kids in the program form teams and
pitch to a team of VCs and entrepreneurs
where a winner is picked and given
cash prizes. In this way, Viswanathan
is helping the younger generation, and
contributing to society by preparing our
leaders for tomorrow. "Also keeps me
young. These kids are amazing!" adds
Viswanathan who shuttles back and
forth between Dallas, Silicon Valley and
Chennai, India where he has built and
is growing an India operation. Looking
ahead, I see us as having a major play
with a differentiating, leading-edge,
niche provider of enterprise software
on the cloud for customers in several
industry verticals. It is demanding, yet
Ram Viswanathan exciting," concludes Viswanathan.
