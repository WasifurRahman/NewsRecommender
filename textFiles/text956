Rodbourne Road: massive crane begins work on bridges, shutting road to pedestrians
Updated 11:25am Monday 2nd May 2016 in
PEDESTRIANS are now feeling the same frustration as drivers after Network Rail closed Rodbourne Road to them as well.
Work to replace one of the ageing bridges over the road, and remove another, got underway in earnest this morning, with a large crane wheeled in alongside the bridges.
For the past fortnight engineers have been carrying out preparatory works on the bridge structure, which resulted in a full road closure.
But pedestrians who needed to get through could still walk down the middle of the road and underneath the bridges.
But in the early hours of this morning after the final train of the night had passed through the railway was shut and the engineers began their work on the structures, which is hoped will be completed over the course of the bank holiday weekend.
The road will remain closed to drivers until the late hours of Sunday, May 15, although pedestrians should once again be able to walk down the road again this coming week.
In the meantime pedestrians are directed to walk around the designer outlet village and through the Great Western Underpass and on to Bristol Street opposite the Mechanics Institute.
In Royal Wootton Bassett engineers are also working on the Marlborough Road/Broad Town Bridge.
While the work is carried out here the temporary footbridge will remain open for pedestrians, but they will need to be escorted across from one side to another by a Network Rail engineer.
The new bridge is expected to be in place by 5am on Tuesday morning.

Why take such a negative view with this article, focusing on the fact that people couldn't walk under the bridges for a few days?
