Some called for a boycott of Old Navy products on the grounds of "white genocide":

Others were far more nuanced in their criticisms...
Open Borders + Forced Integration + Multiracial everything 24/7 + Mixed future for WHITES = #WhiteGenocide. @OldNavy pic.twitter.com/oLoRA1u6wT Ann Kelly (@LadyAodh) May 1, 2016
And this...

Old Navy spokesperson Debbie Felix stood by the campaign, and told Fortune:
We are a brand with a proud history of championing diversity and inclusion.
At Old Navy, everyone is welcome.
