Trowbridge driver, 24, arrested after early morning crash
Updated 9:23am Tuesday 3rd May 2016 in
By Tanya Yilmaz, Trowbridge and Melksham reporter
A 24-YEAR-OLD Trowbridge man was arrested on suspicion of drink driving this morning after he took out a bus stop post before hitting a parked car.
Police were called to Bradley Road just after midnight where they found that the car he was driving had mounted the pavement, taking out a bus stop post, ploughed through two gardens before coming to a stop after hitting a parked car.
The driver then fled the scene.
But police were able to track the man down at his home where he was subsequently arrested.
More to follow.
