Description
Thank you for using OGTS!
Open GPS Tracking System is an alternative to OpenGTS with a user friendly GUI and easy installation.
OGTS is written entirely with Java/JEE/JPA/SWING, currently, it supports French language.
The communication between the GPS and server is made by plain text messages(TCP) and it follows the NMEA protocol.
Currently OGTS supports only TK-103 protocol, if your GPS doest support TK-103 protocol please send me the GPS reference I'll add it for you.
Please subscribe for further updates !
Installation:
1- Create the database schema(see the Database folder), OGTS uses H2 Database but you can use another DBMS.
2- Host the web application whenever you want, you can use Tomcat or GlassFish..
3- run the Daemon.jar in any available port so that GPSs will connect to it.
4- Open a port in your NAT, by default NAT don't allow incoming connection to your local server(read more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)
5- Configure your GPS
