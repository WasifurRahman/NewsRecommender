Manchester may hike parking fees
By PAUL FEELYNew Hampshire Union Leader
Traffic concerns may prompt relocation of gate near new Manchester Walmart
MANCHESTER
It could cost more to park in the Queen City this fall, if a new parking fee structure is approved later this month by city aldermen.The Aldermanic Committee on Public Safety, Health and Traffic heard a request from Parking Manager Denise Boutilier suggesting increases to the citys parking fees. The Board of Mayor and Aldermen last approved parking fee increases in June 2014.Under a proposal submitted by Boutilier for fiscal year 2017, on-street metered parking rates would jump from 75 cents per hour to $1 an hour in fiscal year 2017, generating an additional $350,000 in revenue. Hourly city garage rates would also climb from 75 cents per hour to $1 an hour, generating an estimated $80,000 in additional funds.Monthly parking permits would increase by $5 across the board; i.e. monthly garage permits would go from $85 to $90, creating $35,000 in new revenue. On-street parking permits would go from $55 to $60 a month, generating an estimated $110,000; post-secondary school parking permits would climb from $40 to $45. Permits for parking lots such as the Millyard and the business district would also go up, from $55 to $60 and from $60 to $65, respectively.If approved, Boutilier estimates the fee increases could generate $675,000 in additional revenue. Boutilier suggested $75,000 of that revenue be earmarked to a capital reserve account within the city Parking Division appropriation, to be used for eliminating the gate system at the Victory Garage and replacing it with kiosks. It would also fund repairs to the garage and replace on-street, single-space meters with kiosks.Boutilier said the new fees could be put in place as soon as July 1, but several aldermen advocated for giving downtown businesses, residents and patrons additional time to prepare.If we give them until Oct. 1, it gives them a reprieve for the summer months, said Alderman Bill Barry.I think the longer we can give them, the better, said Alderman Dan ONeil.According to Boutilier, current on-street metered parking fees in Manchester are on par with Concord, Keene and Dover at 75 cents an hour, but far less than what Portsmouth charges at $1.25 to $1.75 an hour. Committee members voted unanimously to recommend the new parking fees to the full board, which is expected to take up the issue later this month.pfeely@unionleader.com..
