Bournemouth fined 7.6m for breaching financial fair play rules
Eddie Howe says he is training the Bournemouth players as hard as ever as they look to end the season on a high note. Bournemouth were fined 7.6 million by the Football League for breaching financial fair play (FFP) rules in their promotion-winning campaign last season.
The club's accounts were published at Companies House on April 29 and they revealed the Cherries had reported a loss of 38.3m as they won the Championship in the 2014-15 campaign.
The Football League set FFP limits of permitted maximum losses at 6m for a season, "consisting of a maximum adjusted loss of 3m plus a further maximum of 3m of shareholder investment."
The size of the fine had not previously been disclosed by the Football League, with details of the penalty being disclosed in the club's accounts
Bournemouth's loss was an increase of some 10.3m for the previous financial period, with staff wages up to 30.4m and with turnover at just under 13m.
According to club accounts, Bournemouth reported a loss of 38.3m last season.
As part of the accounts, Bournemouth also confirmed there had been an outlay of 4.6m for the Vitality Stadium to meet Premier League regulations, as well as a 2m payment to shareholders due following promotion to the top flight for the first time in the club's history.
Bournemouth, currently nine points clear of the relegation zone, have secured their Premier League status for another campaign, which will see a massive increase in revenue following the start of the new broadcasting deal from 2016-17.
In the director notes within the published accounts it was stated: "The directors continue to maintain close control over expenditure and have implemented effective policies and procedures to ensure the club is run efficiently and effectively."
