The arguments on both sides in North Tyneside's mayoral referendum

While June's EU referendum is attracting much attention, voters in part of our region will be voting in an entirely different referendum - on 5th May.
People on North Tyneside are being asked to decide whether their council should continue to be run by a directly elected mayor - or change to a committee system, made up of elected councillors.
Voters will be asked the following question:
"How would you like North Tyneside Council to be run?
a) By a Mayor who is elected by voters. This is how the Council is run now.
OR
b) By one or more committees made up of elected councillors. This would be a change from how the Council is run now."
North Tyneside adopted the mayoral system after a referendum in 2001. Since then, the post has been held by the Conservatives and Labour.
Why is the issue is being put to voters again? It was an election commitment from the current mayor, Labour's Norma Redfearn, before she took office in 2013.

Campaigning to keep an elected mayor is the group North Tyneside says Yes! Its spokesman is the Conservative councillor, Les Miller.
He says the system is good for local democracy, because the mayor is directly accountable to voters.
"Mayors are elected by the general public, they're elected on a four year term. If, after the four years, they feel that the elected mayor hasn't performed, or they disagree with the elected mayor, then the general public has the opportunity to deselected the mayor by voting them out."

Spearheading the movement to scrap the mayoral system is North Tyneside Trades Union Council, which favours switching to a committee system, made up of elected councillors.
Its spokesman, Ian Ayres, says this structure boosts democracy, because decision making is spread across a range of individuals from different parties.
"Power should be for everybody and everybody gets involved. A mayoral system where we have one individual who has multi million pound budgets - it's a lot of power in one person's hands."

Middlesbrough is the only other part of the North East where voters elect a mayor. Hartlepool had its own directly elected mayor for some years, but voters chose to end the system in a referendum in 2013.
Now, voters on North Tyneside have the chance to decide the future of local governance in their borough.
