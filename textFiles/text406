Arsene's post-Norwich comments...
"I am a professional who has given 19 years to this club. I have to accept the judgement of people. The only thing I don't doubt is my sincere commitment to the club. After that I am sorry if I cannot keep 100 per cent happy.
"Maybe it is as well because we have been remarkably consistent. This season was a bit special because we were in a position for a long time where our fans believed we could win the league.
"We didn't and that's why I think it's more disappointed love than real aggression."
"It was a bit of a strange atmosphere. I think the fans were behind the team and I believe as well we did not have the stylish performance that could raise people off their seats.
"We had a serious, studied performance, a bit subdued at stages, but we wanted absolutely to win the game and we did it."
