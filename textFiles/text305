Lisa has to have her gall bladder removed. Jan is out for a few days with a respiratory and ear infection. Armand needs surgery for an infection in his face.
Jack stops to provide part time caregiving for his mom.
I hope those 3 are okay. I bet they are. They will bounce back, just as I will.
Go to the word Menu. Click on it and then click on Mission. Their ya go.
The Mission has never changed.
God bless us all! Wow, we all try so hard! When I say we, I mean you too.
Been sitting under moms carport enjoying the rain. It stopped and I am going in.

This is a beautiful area to jog and walk in. I passed sod farms and pecan orchards. The drivers were, as usual, very courteous.
I waved a lot and they all waived back. Fort Valley has a population of nearly 10,000.

Its partly cloudy in Roberta, Georgia. As I was typing that, the sun popped out from behind a cloud. Change can be fast.
Yesterday, mom pointed out how many squirrels spend time in her yard. She enjoys watching.
the crape myrtle is beautiful
Since I began this post, all the clouds moved on.
We may travel today. Travel can be energizing. Maybe its the change in scenery.

4.46 miles today on Charity Miles for the Alzheimers Association.
The death of an acquaintance stunned me this evening. I met him one time. He was a very young man. Damn.
Im doing well, but I just dont know what to do sometimes. Wish I could help more.
Some days I wish I could be out west on Route 66 and experience it one more time.
Ah, its a great life either way. Keep going, keep swimming, never give up on life.

did I run when I weighed 273lbs?
Posted on May 1, 2016 | Leave a comment
No. Once I made the decision to lose the weight, I read about the situation I found myself in.
6 foot tall, 273 lbs and just coming out off a near death situation, that was not an accident. That was important because my body had been subject to a long period of time that certainly caused damage.
I had to be concerned about my musculoskeletal system and mainly my heart. They had found I have a valve that leaks, and my left lung is heavily scarred from 4 battles with pneumonia, starting at age 1.
I shot for a 20 minute mile and when that got doable, I shot for 2 each 20 minute miles, and then 3. After that, I went for a 15 minute mile and so on and so forth. No running and no jogging.
It wasnt until 2006 that I began to jog. Then when that became comfortable, I ran. I was 56 years old when I became a runner.
I am 65 now and choose to start easing off on the running. I want to be able to jog on into my 90s. I manage my resources well and I am looking forward to many more years of picking em up and laying em down.
I have become my own expert at running.
I hope everyone has time and the health to get aerobic exercise.

the Bobomobile got abath
Posted on May 1, 2016 | Leave a comment
This car was donated by Marcia Bobo. It came with a minimum price. I was asked to pay when I could. I was also asked to pay the money as a donation to the Alzheimers Association. Pretty cool huh?
The Bobomobile has been from here to California and back two times with me. It uses a little oil, but not much.

the Awesome lady at Chic filA
Posted on May 1, 2016 | Leave a comment
mom and some of our family were eating in a restaurant last night and she (mom) noticed a lady wearing an alzheimers shirt. Mom initiated a conversation. It seems that Gleniss had an alzheimers connection either now, or in the past and had attended a Walk to End Alzheimers event.
This lady told mom that she wears the shirt in public so folks will think of alzheimers. She is raising awareness.
A lot of caregivers that attend a Walk, keep coming back, even after the loss of their friend or loved one. Thats pretty darn awesome!

What is aerobicexercise?
Posted on May 1, 2016 | Leave a comment
Aerobic activity trains the heart, lungs and cardiovascular system to process and deliver oxygen more quickly and efficiently to every part of the body. It burns a lot calories.

some things I have learned on this 47 monthjourney
Posted on May 1, 2016 | Leave a comment
Dont do anything fancy.
See the people, often, that you are trying to help, and always be accessible to them.
Be who you really are at all times. If strangers speak about you, and your close friends and family wonder who in the heck they are talking about, that might signal a problem.
I am not an ultra runner.
Its not a track and field event.
I am not a movie star.
I am a quiet man that gets nervous around a big group of people.
I care about caregivers.
I have family and friends that me.
I have family and friends that I need.
Sometimes I get tired.
I care about the fight with Alzheimers disease.
I respect the mission of the Alzheimers Association.
A lot of people have helped me in my life.
God is Great!

running
Posted on April 30, 2016 | Leave a comment
It was a means to an end for me, at first. To reach the level of fitness I required for myself, I need aerobic exercise 4 to 5 times each week. I was tired of popping the CD in and turning on the television. Frankly, I was also disgusted with being inside.
My running was born from that.
Folks, that should know, tell me that good cardiovascular health slows, and in some cases even prevents disease.
Dr. Kenneth Cooper has been broadcasting that for years. I have a very healthy respect for Mr. Cooper.
I love running at a 12 minute per mile pace and breaking it up with walking and stopping to, so to speak, to smell the roses.
I do however continue to keep my heart rate at 75% of my maximum, for 30 minutes, 4 times a week. The low pace is what I am counting on to keep my musculoskeletal system in good enough shape to be able to run into my 90s. The aerobics hopefully, will help keep me healthy.
