Best and worst dressed at the 2016 Met Gala
1/48
Back to Gallery
New York's Met Gala is one of the year's biggest opportunities for A-list celebrities to show off their fashion sense.
After all, it is put on by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. But while some stars pull off an outrageous look that will be talked about until next year's party, others wind up copying their younger sisters' gowns, then adding a creepy hypnotized guy in the background (we're looking at you, Kim Kardashian).
This year's "Manus x Machina" theme, highlighting the difference between fashion made by hand (very expensive) and fashion made by machine (still pretty expensive), gave celebs plenty of room for interpretation.
There were numerous attempts to seize control of the galaxy in shiny, spacey structured gowns, an intense ball gown showdown, and a surprising number of young women trying to look 20 years older than they really are.
Click through the slideshow to see the best and worst looks of the night.
