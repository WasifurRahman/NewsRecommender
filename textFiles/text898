Jailed American mother fights for girls custodyWoman says she kept her six-year-old daughter with a neighbour who is now claiming to be the biological fatherPublished: 15:15 May 3, 2016 Bassam Za'za', Legal and Court CorrespondentAdd to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisDubai: A mother has been battling for more than three years to regain custody of her six-year-old daughter who was kept with her neighbours after a court jailed her in a case.When the American mother was imprisoned by a court for her involvement in consensual sex case in 2012, she kept her daughter with her Sudanese neighbours to take care of her temporarily as she has no direct relatives and the girls biological father resides abroad.After the mother finished her imprisonment the same year, the neighbours refused to give back the girl and the male neighbour claimed that he was the father of the six-year-old and that the American mother was his wife.The American mother, according to court records obtained by Gulf News, refused to be deported without her daughter and initiated a legal battle to win back her daughters custody that shes fighting from inside prison.The woman cannot leave prison since theres a court order to have her deported.In her lawsuit before the Sharjah Courts, the woman presented certificates proving her marriage to the girls biological father and the daughters birth certificate (born in 2010).The American also presented a certificate confirming that she also gave birth to a boy from the same biological father to convince the court that she has never been married to the Sudanese neighbour.The defendants claims that we were ever married or that he is the girls biological father are baseless, unfounded and fabricated. He has failed to prove that we ever married. His witnesses testimonies that we were married were false. He has never been able to corroborate his allegations that he was my husband or that he fathered the girl. I delivered her in the UAE in 2010 and the Sudanese birth certificate, of which he [defendant] provided a copy to the court, is clearly forged, especially as its dated 2013. Why would he wait three years to issue a birth certificate and from Sudan?His main purpose is to benefit from my daughters nationality and a cheap attempt to obtain an American passport for him and his wife. I have repeatedly requested the primary court to have the defendant undergo a DNA test to confirm whether hes the biological father, which he isnt. He has been exploiting the fact that Im behind bars to win my girls custody and achieve the aforementioned personal gains [obtaining the American passport]. My girl was never born in Sudan and has never visited it. The defendant has been arguing otherwise, the mother argued in her lawsuit before the Sharjah Appeal Court.In December, the Abu Dhabi Federal Court reversed the case back to the appellate court in Sharjah because prosecutors should have provided the Appeal Court with a written or verbal legal opinion as it involves a minor. The Appeal Court then requested prosecutors to give their legal opinion.Prosecutors replied that they will leave the final decision [pertaining to the DNA test] to the appellate court.Meanwhile, the mother asked the appellate court to dismiss the defendants counter lawsuit in which he alleges that he had married the American mother which resulted in the birth of the six-year-old girl.Despite the fact that he produced witnesses who alleged that he had married me, that doesnt conclusively confirm or prove his fatherhood. The biological father did not appear in court and testify that hes the real father
but that by itself does not deny the fact that hes the real father. My son currently lives with his biological father, who has, for unforeseen and inhuman reasons, refused to testify in court that hes the biological father following a lawful marriage that still stands till today. We have repeatedly asked prosecutors and the legal authorities to carry out the required DNA test to prove that the defendant is not the biological father he claims to be. The countrys legal system remains my last and only hope to take back my daughter and have us reunited despite the defendants illegal and unfounded attempt to take her away from me, contended the mother in her lawsuit.Gulf News has learnt that the Appeal Court [in April] dismissed the American womans lawsuit.Thereafter she has appealed that ruling in an attempt to present her case before the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi and try to get custody of the child from the neighbour.A hearing will be scheduled soon before the capitals highest court.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from Courts Jailed American mother fights for girls custody03:15 pmWoman lands in court after complaint of stalkerWaiter lands in court over 500gm of drugMaid accused of stealing sponsors passportDrunk man threatens to burn accommodationWoman in court for attacking man with wine glassInvestor jailed for causing Dh8.4m lossKiller seeking early release after 2001 murder tags from this storyUnited Arab Emiratesfollow this tag on MGNAbu Dhabifollow this tag on MGNDubaifollow this tag on MGNSudanfollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsNewsUAECourtstagsUnited Arab Emiratesfollow this tag on MGN+MGNAbu Dhabifollow this tag on MGN+MGNDubaifollow this tag on MGN+MGNSudanfollow this tag on MGN+MGNAlso In CourtsWoman lands in court after complaint of stalker 					News Gallery Shiite pilgrims converge on Baghdad shrineUS cruise in decades docks in Havana
