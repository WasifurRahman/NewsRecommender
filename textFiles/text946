Farmers distraught after bizarre poisoning of 10 in-calf cattle

By Bruno Clements
TEN cattle have been poisoned at Wiltshire barn.
Police say that 'an unknown poisonous substance' was added to water troughs in an open barn at Ham, near Great Bedwyn, containing 67 in-calf beef cattle between Wednesday and Thursday, April 27 and 28.
"By Friday morning ten were dead along with unborn calves - it's clearly upsetting for all involved," said PCSO John Bordiss.
Anyone with information should call Wiltshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
