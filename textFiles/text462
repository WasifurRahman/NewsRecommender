Letter: Inequitable bond
obligations in Burlingame
May 03, 2016, 05:00 AM Letter
Editor,
Burlingame is considering a $50 million bond measure to fund a new community center.
General obligation bonds are being examined. They would be paid back with new taxes based on property owners assessed
not current market
values. As such, those who bought their homes over the past 10 to 15 years would be shouldering most of the burden among all homeowners. This approach seems particularly unfair for funding civic assets that provide an equitable community benefit.
Approximately 1,200 single-family residences in Burlingame, representing 20 percent of all SFRs, have an assessed value of less than $200,000. The estimated tax for $50 million of G.O. bonds is $33 per $100,000 of assessed value. Thus, 1,200 residences would be paying no more than $66 per year, while newer homeowners would be paying several hundreds of dollars annually.
Bottom line is, the ability to contribute ones fair share is not simply a function of when someone purchased his or her property. An assessed value tax in Burlingame would be a huge, unnecessary subsidy paid for by newer property owners.
More equitable funding methods exist. Burlingames storm drain fee for example, which is not based on assessed value, offers a means-based deferral and supports revenue bonds.
Moreover, the city is projected to have approximately $4 million of additional annual debt service capacity from existing revenue in a couple of years. Therefore, Burlingame could probably issue $60 million to $70 million of new debt in short order without any additional revenue.
