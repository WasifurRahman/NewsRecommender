Three fire crews have been in Peatmoor extinguishing the blaze behind Co-op
Updated 7:24pm Sunday 1st May 2016 in
By Amber Hicks
SHOPPERS were evacuated after a fire ripped through rubbish behind the Co-op store in Peatmoor thisafternoon.
Three fire crews weretackling the blaze in Peatmoor Village Centre afterreceivinga phone call just before4.30pm.
It is believed to have been caused byan air conditioning unit and crews from Swindon, Strattonand Westlea were at the scene.
A large amount of debris that caught alight canbe seen behind the store and Bengal Square, the curry house, which is stillopen for business.
Fire crews rapid response meant the flames did not spread and destroy any buildings, but there was a large amount of smoke damage.
Residents living in the flats above the businesses, including RoughmoorVillageFish&Chips and William Hill betting shop, were also evacuated.
No one was hurt and police were also in attendance.
See the extent of the damage in the video at the bottom of this article.
Westlea firefighter Richard Last said: It is a small fire to the rear of the Co-op and it was fully alight when we arrived. It was extinguished using breathing apparatus and hose reel jets.
We came in from the front and we could see smoke issuing from above and came around and saw it was coming from outside.
At the moment the external air conditioning has been destroyed. Internally it is really just smoke damage.
All the flats were evacuated and most of them were empty anyway. The ones that were in have left and we have checked for smoke spread and it is all clear now.
We are unsure of the cause as of yet. I think the first person that was aware of the fire was the manager from the Co-op.
We would also like to mention to some of the shop owners who work around here perhaps to take a look at their risk assessments.
Any build-up to the rear of the property needs to be dealt with to reduce the likelihood of this sort of incident happening. If there are any concerns contact the council.
One fire crew was still on the scene as on 6.30pm while they waiting for the housing association and electricians to arrive to complete some admin before they leave.

How does breathing apparatus actually
extinguish a fire , does one blow through it to blow out the flames or does one physically beat it out with it.
