Demi Lovato in Moschino at the Met Gala: one of the worst looks or ok?
May 03, 2016

Demi Lovato was one of a couple ladies in Moschino last night and her dress was one of the worst, in my opinion. Its like designer Jeremy Scott tried to mix one of his signature patters, that kind of modern brocade, with silver sequins and it does not work at all. Theres an asymmetric double matte stripe running across a silver dress. How does that make any sense? Then again, this guy wore a black suit made to look like a onesie with a bedazzled skeleton on the top of it, which even extended to his shoes. If he was going for whimsical he just ended up looking like he was dressed for Halloween.

Nicki Minaj similarly looked like she was wearing a Halloween costume in this buckled dominatrix getup. How does this have anything to do with Magnus x Machina or technology at all? These designers had the opportunity to go for robotic looks, retro futurism, or to incorporate technology into their designs and some of them just phoned it in. Does this show that Scott is not inventive at all or is he just sticking to his own style? I like his whimsical takes on Barbie, McDonalds and Spongebob so this is a disappointment.
Speaking of Spongebob, people on Twitter were comparing Nickis dress to Mr. Krabs.
Nicki Minaj looks so fire as Mr. Krabs

Madonna needs to put it away. All of it.
Im waiting for Emilys Ratajwhatevers pics. I have never seen anybody trying SO hard.
I mean, if she arched her back a bit more she would have snapped in two.

Agreed Madonna was just terrible.
The pattern on Demis dress let her down because I thought the silhouette was great for her body. Nicki was just unfortunate and worse than Demi as well

I loved Demis too!
Thought that it really fits the theme without falling back on the metallic look which seemed to be every other stylists first idea.
The yellow/orange really pops in the photographs, sort of like its interactive or virtual.
Shes one of my best looks of the night <3

Nicky Minaj should try covering those fake boobs once in a
while. She is starting to resemble Lil Kim and it is not a compliment.

Demi looks like she is in pain and her whole look is very mother-of-the bride.

Its odd.
I kind of like Demis gown up close, but at a distance, not at all.
Nicki is a hot mess.

I was upset Rihanna didnt come also.
She was the star last year.
This is the worst Met Gala Ball Ive seen.
BORING.
Ball?
Most must have missed that part and dressed like it was another night out for a celebrity at some function or bar for some.
LOL
