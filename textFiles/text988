On your marks, get set, go Big Pledge
11:18am Tuesday 3rd May 2016 in
By Richard Mills, Reporter
THE official launch of the Olympic-themed Big Pledge - Road to Rio challenge got underway last Thursday (April 28) at Corsham's Springfield Community Campus.
Led by Great Britain kayaker Hannah Brown, the Wiltshire Council campaign began with the council's community engagement managers collectively travelling 150 miles.
The Big Pledge will run for eight weeks from June 4-July 29 and challenges participants to run, cycle, walk, row and skip their way through 20 stages and take a virtual journey around the planet.
Ms Brown, who was at the launch and hopes to be part of the Rio Olympics, said: I am honoured to be supporting the Big Pledge Road to Rio. As part of Team GB I know its great to have the support of your teammates so why not get your workplace, school or community group to sign up as a team.
"This is a great way to get active, have fun and join in the exciting build up to the Games. So what are you waiting for? Make your pledge today and join the road to Rio.
This is the third year of Wiltshires Big Pledge and, as part of the councils Legacy for Wiltshire programme, it aims to improve the health and wellbeing of Wiltshires communities.
Wiltshire Council corporate director, Maggie Rae said: We couldnt resist adding an Olympic twist to this years Big Pledge and it promises to be a fun challenge, which will certainly have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of those taking part. I hope the Olympic theme will inspire many people to get involved in activities and have fun doing so. I wish everyone good luck on their virtual trip to Rio
Wiltshire Council cabinet member with responsibility for sport, Jonathon Seed, added: The legacy of 2012 certainly lives on strongly in Wiltshire and this years Big Pledge will get everyone in the Olympic spirit and be lots of fun for everyone involved.
"We want Wiltshire to be full of happy, healthy communities and campaigns such as this help encourage people to put on their trainers and get more active. Good luck to everyone taking part.
