Devizes skateboarder's Channel challenge from Bath to Bristol
3:49pm Monday 2nd May 2016 in
By Patrick McLean, Devizes reporter
A MAN from Devizes is preparing to skateboard his way from Bath to Bristol to raise money for charity.
James Threllfall, 22, of Green Lane, Devizes, is taking part in his works charity event, The Channel Challenge, where people are raising money by covering the 21-mile distance to represent the journey across the water to France.
Mr Threllfall, who works at youth charity Inner Flame in Swindon, said: At the charity we help children develop skills for life and work, and are part of the Princes Trust, which helps young people find work. We are trying to get everyone to take part in the fundraiser and because I am a professional skateboarder I got roped into doing it as well.
So I will be skateboarding from Bath to Bristol and back in one day, which equates to about 26 miles. I set myself the target of 200 and so far I have raised 68, but I am confident I will smash my target.
Mr Threllfall, who found his passion for skateboarding when he used to live in Melksham, has been skating for the past 10 years, travelling all over the world.
I started at Melksham skate park, which I have recently successfully campaigned for to have a redevelopment by Wiltshire Council. I started there and it would be great for the next generation of skaters to have the work carried out.
My skating has taken me to Morocco, Sweden, America, Prague, Berlin. I feel very lucky.
Even though he admits to having a good level of experience in skateboarding, Mr Threllfall has admitted he is slightly worried about the fundraiser.
I am genuinely worried. I feel like it should be a challenge I can do easily due to my experience but I havent really done any training and I am worried I probably should have. I am going to try and enjoy it as much as possible, even if my legs are going to hurt afterwards, he said.
