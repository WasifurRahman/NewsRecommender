Claire Danes in illuminated Zac Posen at the Met Gala: perfection, breathtaking?
May 03, 2016

Everyone was buzzing on Twitter over this illuminated Zac Posen gown. It was unknown at first who would be wearing it and initially the rumor was that Heidi Klum would arrive in this amazing dress. Given Heidis tendency to look ridiculous on the red carpet, this kind of effort seemed wasted on her, so thankfully that story was false. Claire Danes showed up in this dress, which perfectly fit the Manus x Machina theme and drew comparisons to Cinderella, at least when the dress was unlit. When lit, all I could think of was Katnisss flaming gown at the Hunger Games.
Look at the video of this dress. The slightly frayed edges are lines of light which edge the hem, waistline and down the bodice. The skirt and rest of the dress look like a starry night. Zac Posen designed with light and made it a feature of the gown. Zac Posen is Cinna. Claire explained in an interview on the red carpet (thats below) that she had a stool to sit on during the event because she couldnt sit in a typical chair. Like Karolina Kurkova in her lit up Marchesa, she rode in a bus to the event as she couldnt sit down, but this design and execution is superior in every way. Its amazing.
Manic moments!! Zacposen #metgala #clairedanes

I feel bad for the other women Im lumping in this post, because after Claire everyone else can just go home, but we have a lot to get through today. Brie Larsons ruffled tiered Proenza Schouler was like a longer, less inspired version of Taylor Swifts Louis Vuitton. The similar dressed, which are both silver with patterned sequin, are sleeveless with ruffles, have side cutouts and black detailing, are likely a case of great minds with a bunch of fashion trends lumped together. That said, I think Taylors dress worked the theme a bit more. I do like the scalloping on Bries dress. Her slicked back hair and dark lip fit the motif. Those witchy shoes need to go though.
Continuing the silver trend we have Naomi Watts, in mirrored Burberry. This dressis slightly similar to the Armani gown which Naomi wore to the Oscars in that its strapless and full length with a similar shape. I love how this fits her like a glove and has just the right amount of floral sunburst detailing. Her understated makeup, wavy hair and diamond jewelry complement the look so well.

Claire is the winner of the night for me
she rarely ever delivers fashion wise but she killed it last night.
And lol I said the exact same thing when I saw Brie Larson, her dress is crazy similar to Taylors.
And Naomi looks beautiful but I feel like this is a look she clearly loves
it looks great on her but its nothing new.

ITA, Dani, Claire is the winner of the night. Finally someone took the theme and got creative, instead of just draping themselves in silver. I love the dress so much!

Wow for Claire!
I like all these gowns to be honest.
Perhaps they work best in low light?

Lovely. A shame they could not find a way to light to effect on the red carpet.
Though all the flashbulbs would have probably made it explode!

That is pretty darn cool (Claires gown).
I agree about Bries shoes, those look a bit old-school.
If I could look like Naomi Watts for one day.

Gorgeous dress on Claire! Am I terrible for thinking such an amazing idea was wasted on someone as basic as her? Now imagine that dress on someone like Lupita!!!

O.O youre totally right lol, in a way Im glad that someone who almost never stands out at these type of events was undoubtedly THE stand-out.
But youre totally right, can you imagine if this was on Lupita or Fan Bingbing??

Slow clap for Claire! Absolutely flawless. The detailing on that gown, even without the illumination, is just stunning. Perfect hair and make-up too.

It looks like something from Disneys Spectromagic or Main Street Electrical Parade. I just wasnt impressed with this BC Ive seen Cinderella, Aurora and Belle wearing the same idea.

Gimmick and fashion are not the same thing. Lets wear clothes that glow in the dark. That you cant see anything special about unless the lights are out? Im sorry, I think its very silly, and her styling is terrible. I guess I get the stick in the mud award today.

@GNAT I think its a beautiful dress, albeit perhaps not terribly original design without the lighting effect.
It also looks like its beautifully constructed and actually fits her (something all to rare these days). That said, I think this is one of those Met gala themes (like the punk one a few years ago) that was was going to attract a lot of ugly as some inevitably interpreted
any modern or futuristic theme as bondage sex toy shop.

It would be a very beautiful traditional wedding dress, I think. And it does fit her very well.

ha ha I do see what you mean.I do think it was very on theme versus the usual look at me Im a discoball robot, I am just soooooooo disappointed it was on HER. I think with someone else, with some mad styling it would have been so cool

Snazzy I couldnt agree more. Additionally, I find her to be almost too smug and intolerable, and therefore I could almost
Imagine this dress giving her a Goop like inflated ego and sense of self.
Shes way too blah to wear this. Even the way she walks in it, shes not owning the fact that this is magical for the event, shes kind of taking a page from The Taylor Swift school of feign surprise.
Hmmm, this seems to have annoyed me more than it should! Haha. (:

My fashion obsessed friend texted me last night saying that she needed resuscitation after seeing Claire Daness dress So Im assuming this is a good thing. It looks pretty boring to me except for the light up part Giving me serious Cinderella vibes.

I think is too young and Princessy but at least
she is on theme and commited so off that alone and SJP looking like a Hamilton Extra i Have to give it to Claire
Also for shame that an Oscar Winner cant get a better dress
Also this was very lacking in imagination overall very uninspired, I Rented a Badgley Mishka gold dress for a wedding last week and the impression I get is that I could have worn it at the MET gala no biggie and That Is not a Compliment, Im a Peon with no access
