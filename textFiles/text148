Tesla Motors
Electric car manufacturer Tesla is setting up shop in Sydney, with a stand-alone showroom coming to 20 Martin Place in Q3 of 2016. Tesla has two other stores in Artarmon, North Sydney and Richmond, Melbourne, but these are both attached to service centres and charging stations. The Martin Place store will be two storeys of pure Tesla shopping experience. Customers will be able to view and test drive Tesla vehicles from the underground car park below the store, design and order their own custom car, and purchase Tesla merchandise.Tesla also noted that none of its showrooms are franchised, which means customers will always deal directly with Tesla staff.Tags: Tech IndustryCar TechDiscuss: Tesla showroom coming to Sydney's Martin...Conversation powered by LivefyreShow CommentsHide CommentsFeatured Video
