Letter: Sugar executive offers some misleading claims

Letter: Sugar executive offers some misleading claims
Sugar executive Ryan Weston (April 17 letter) states that sugar cane growers don't get subsidies from the government. The truth is that the government allows U.S. growers approximately 75 percent of the market at prices way over world sugar prices to protect the approximately 4,800 sugar growers and processors.
To ensure that prices do not fall below a government-mandated price floor, the USDA loans money to sugar processors, with the sugar being collateral for the loan.
Processors in turn agree to pay sugar growers a minimum price. If the market price of the sugar rises, processors sell their sugar on the market to pay back the loan. If it falls, however, processors can forfeit their sugar to the government rather than re-paying the loan.
This way, the price of sugar is guaranteed for both growers and processors.
Analysts estimate that U.S. consumers and businesses pay anywhere from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in higher costs due to the government's inflation of sugar prices.
Second, as far as cleansing the industry's agricultural pollution, TCPalm in January reported South Florida Water Management District was back-pumping polluted water into Lake O. It wasn't sugar growers; it was SFWMD, but it was back-pumped and it was polluted.
Since then, over 100 billion gallons have been released into the St. Lucie River and twice that sent west.
Sugar growers talk about how much they care about repairing the Herbert Hoover dike so the lake can hold more water, but the truth is, the lake is not intended to hold more water. It is intended to hold less.
