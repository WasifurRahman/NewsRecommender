Hamilton, the hit Broadway musical about the American founding father, is expected to sweep todays announcement of this years Tony nominations. But even without a win, Mirandas historic hit could smash records.Nineteen other new musicals and plays are eligible for the 24 awards that will be announced June 12, broken up into acting and technical categories. The current record for most Tony wins goes to the 2001 production of The Producers, which had 15 nominations and won 12 awards. The 2005 Billy Elliot the Musical also garnered 15 nominations, but walked away with 10 wins.Miranda is no stranger to Tony nominations: his 2007 In The Heights was nominated for 13 Tony awards and won four, including one for himself for Best Original Score. That musical also won Miranda a Grammy for the cast album, and another Tony performance won Miranda an Emmy in 2014.Hamilton is even likelier to bring home awards. Since its opening in August, the musical has netted the composer and star a Pulitzer, a MacArthur genius grant and another Grammy award.The one prize that has eluded Miranda thus far has been the Oscar, awarded to films, which would make Miranda the third PEGOT winner in history with Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch. It would also make him the first MacPEGOT winner, including the MacArthur grant. Miranda is working on a movie score for the upcoming Disney movie Moana, and has noted his desire to turn Hamilton into a film with the current cast on Twitter.But even without any other wins, Hamilton is bound for more success. Tickets for the runaway hit are re-selling for hundreds, and a national tour is expected to start in San Francisco next year.
