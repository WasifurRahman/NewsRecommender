Diverse range of factors could contribute to cyanobacteria growth

Opihi River near Temuka has had warning signs up over the summer advising the public of its high levels of cyanobacteria.
A diverse range of factors can lead to high levels of potentiallytoxin-producingphormidium, also known as cyanobacteria, growingin rivers in South Canterbury.The bacteria has been problematic in the area during summer, with fivesites having signs up at various pointsadvising the public levels of the bacteria were unsafe.Those sites were the Opihi River at State Highway 1, the Opihi at Waipopo Huts, theOpihi at Saleyards, the Temuka River atSH1 and the Pareora River at Evans Crossing.The toxin can be dangerous to animals: ithas killed 100 dogs in New Zealand the past five years.Canterbury University PHD student Tara McAllister detailed her research at theOrari Temuka Opihi Pareora zone committee meeting in Timaru on Monday."Thetoxinsphormidiumsproduceare really, reallypotent, they're equivalent to cobra venom.Only one teaspoon is required to kill a 25kg dog," McAllister said. McAllisterconducted research on the bacteria at eight sites, once a week each week for six months beginningin October 2014.Five of the siteswere at theOpihi, Orari, Temuka, Pareora andWaihi rivers.Each week she examined the bottom of the river as to how much of it was covered in the thick dark-brown mats it forms.McAllister measured manyfactors in the riversincluding temperature, river flow, turbidity,level of dissolved nitrates and phosphates and the leveldissolved metals.

During the course of her research,McAllister removed temperature as a factor as the bacteriawas found growing in rivers with avarietyof temperatures.In relation to nutrient levels,McAllister found goodgrowth was evident when there were intermediate levels of nitrate and phosphate.In other rivers she found bacteriagrowth appeared to dowell in swift flowing water with intermediate nitrate levels.While in some cases"if bigger rivers get smaller they're more susceptible to growth," there were other cases where as flow decreased, the bacteria cover also decreased.Environment Canterbury representative Shirley Hayward said phormidiummight have always been present in New Zealand, "but things have changed to make it grow more".Hayward said itfirst became a real issue in New Zealand in the mid 2000s, andit could be that a particular genus which produces toxins has become more prevalent.The bacteria can be found all over the world, andis becoming an issue in other countries such as the United States of America.
