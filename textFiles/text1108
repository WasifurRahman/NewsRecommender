FFA to close transfer loophole exploited by Man City's Caceres move
Anthony Caceres left the Central Coast Mariners to join Melbourne City, via Manchester City, in January.
Football Federation Australia has proposed an A-League transfer rule change to close the loophole that allowed Manchester City to sign Anthony Caceres from Central Coast and then loan him straight to sister club Melbourne City.
In January, key league figures called for a review of the rules following Caceres' controversial mid-season loan switch, which occurred just days after English giants Manchester City had signed the 23-year-old midfielder from the Mariners.
Wellington coach Ernie Merrick labelled the move "farcical," while Sydney FC chief executive Tony Pignata said it was clear FFA needed to revisit its framework.
Under current A-League rules, clubs within the competition are prohibited from transferring players between themselves.
The loaning of Caceres to City is wrong. How can @FFA allow this? There are no transfers between @ALeague clubs yet it seems you can by pass Tony Pignata (@tpignata9) January 19, 2016
In response, the governing body has approached clubs for feedback about a proposed update to its regulations it is hopeful would come into effect next season.
Under the added provision, a former A-League player signed with an overseas club would not be able to register with an A-League club under the same owner until a certain period of time has lapsed.
That would be the earlier of: The end of the term remaining on the player's contract with their immediately preceding A-League club, or once two A-League registration periods have passed from the date of their transfer overseas.
"FFA has conducted a review of the National Registration Regulations, in particular the regulations covering transfers within the Hyundai A-League clubs," an FFA spokesperson said.
"The clubs have been asked for feedback on the review and proposed changes.
"No changes will be made until the feedback is considered."
