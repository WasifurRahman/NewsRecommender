By Robin Murray, Reporter
A GREAT British-themed Communi-tea party was staged for customers and staff at Morrisons in Westbury on Bank Holiday Monday.
The tea party raised money for the supermarket's charity partner-Sue Ryder, which provides hospice and neurological care for people facing a frightening and lifechanging diagnosis.
Hundreds of customers came through the doors to enjoy hot and cold drinks, a piece of cake and a raffle, which was a particularly popular activity and brought in plenty of customers.
Lisa Litterick, the store's community champion, said: "We had an incredible turn out.
So many staff and customers joined in to make it one of the most fun events we have done in store.
I am always blown away by the generosity of our loyal customers, Westbury truly is an amazing community and I feel privileged to be a part of it."
Jan Johnson, Sharon Reeves and Lisa Litterick manned the table from 10am- 4.30pm, ensuring all customers left the supermarket with an understanding of the charitys work, and a piece of cake.
Morrisons raised a total of 321, with money still coming in, toppinglast years total of 232.
The supermarkets attention is now on making its Summer Market as successful as the Communi-tea party, which will be on July 9 from 9am-3pm and will also raise money for Sue Ryder.
