Paul Tudor Jones: I'm going to see first and foremost, men of character
After that failure with the older kids, Tudor Jones is focused now on the starting line.
Paul Tudor Jones: Today we're going to blow this. The race starts after you leave this room today. Are you guys ready? I can't hear you. Are you guys ready? Ready, set, (whistle blow)
After 25 years of Robin Hood, countless lives have been changed but the city's poverty rate doesn't. It's about 20 percent year in and year out. If Robin Hood is a hedge fund for humanity, then a Wall Street trader would say that Tudor Jones is buying on the "futures" market -- a bet that investing in young children and families will pay big dividends in the next generation.
Paul Tudor Jones: I don't think there's ever actually a point where you can say I won. It's a constant battle. I could see myself, I could see myself with the coffin lid dropping and me still knocking on the top of it, trying to get out, 'cause I think there'll still be a war to fight.
Scott Pelley: And more to do.
Paul Tudor Jones: And more to do.
