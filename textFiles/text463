edit data
Jennifer Bonds writes sizzling contemporary romance with sassy heroines, sexy heroes, and a whole lot of mischief. When shes not writing or wrangling toddlers, she can be found curled up with a good book and a bottle of wine. Jennifer lives in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where her overactive imagination and weakness for reality TV keep life interesting. Shes lucky enough to live with her own real life hero, two adorable children, and a pair of rambunctious dogs. Loves Buffy, Mexican food, the Winchester brothers, and all things zombie. Sings off-key.You can also connect with Jen at:https://www.facebook.com/jenniferbond...https://www.facebook.com/authorjjbonds

Quotes by Jennifer Bonds
You know, she stammered, resenting the way her body reacted to his touch with fireworks and songbirds, I kind of hate you sometimes.If thats code for I want to fuck you until I cant walk straight, then I kind of hate you, too.

She shouldnt be this close to Cole, not alone, not even when she was pissed beyond belief. It was too dangerous, since she had yet to find a cure for I-hate-you-but-I-want-to-fuck-your-brains-out-itis.
