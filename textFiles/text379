"We have long enjoyed a very successful relationship with the Asian Tour, and adding a new co-sanctioned event to our schedule is another positive step forward."The event is returning to the Asian Tour schedule having been first played in 2009, with Thaworn Wiratchant taking the title ahead of Andrew Dodt and Anirban Lahiri the last time it was held in 2014.
Anirban Lahiri finished joint runner-up in the event two years' ago
Kyi Hla Hand, Asian Tour Commissioner, said: "The Asian Tour and our talented players look forward to returning to Thailand for the King's Cup. This is a fantastic development for golf as it reinforces yet again the growing strength of the game in Asia."We are also delighted to co-sanction the King's Cup with our long-time partner, the European Tour. I believe the addition of 25 European Tour players in the field will strengthen what is already a highly-regarded and prestigious golf tournament."
