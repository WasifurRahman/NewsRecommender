There were lots of big winners in southwest Connecticut last month for those who got lucky with CT Lottery games.
The biggest winner was Charles Rossi, of Middlebury, who won $1 million from a winning $5,000 a month for life ticket sold at Peoples Choice Mobil of Southbury. Rossi opted to claim his $5,000 a month for life top prize as a one-time cash lump-sum of $1,000,000 (value before taxes).
Another big winner was Cynthia Ostrosky, of Fairfield, who cashed in her winning Lucky for Life ticket, after playing her favorite numbers.
I looked at the winning numbers and thought they looked familiar, Ostrosky told Lottery officials when she cashed in her ticket. She said she had bought four tickets for the drawing.
When I got to my last ticket, I saw I had four numbers. Thats when I woke my husband up and told him, I think I won something big! It wasnt until we got here at Lottery headquarters that we really knew for sure that we were the only (second prize) winner (in the game) and actually won $25,000 a year for life.
If the annuity prize option is chosen, the minimum guaranteed amount Lucky for Life second prize winners could receive is $500,000 ($25,000 a year for 20 years), but those who live longer than that receive prize payments for the remainder of their natural life. Second prize winners also have the option to claim their prize in a one-time cash lump sum of $390,000.
Ostrosky, accompanied by her husband Michael, arrived at Lottery headquarters opting for the games $25,000 a year - every year - for life annuity prize. This is a very happy day. We are just so thankful, Ostrosky said. We chose the annuity prize, because wed rather have money every year that we can count on. It will be such a big help. Its really unbelievable.
There were also several $100,000 winners including three alone from Danbury.
Of course, we dont know the names of the people who lost playing the lottery last month. But the folks at CT Lottery do post the names of the winners.
