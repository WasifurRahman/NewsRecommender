Depending on the evolution of the smart home market, CSPs that take a low-commitment approach to the opportunity can easily cut their losses if prospects for CSPs in the smart home space are bleak, or, alternatively, they can escalate their commitment with successive solution launches or modifications if prospects look more favourable.
Communications service providers (CSPs) can take a low-commitment approach to the smart home opportunity by reselling smart home devices and providing ancillary services, instead of launching full smart home services. This may be a starting point for CSPs to offer more advanced services in the future.
This report provides:
a description of the low-commitment approach
profiles of two CSPs taking the low-commitment approach
recommendations for CSPs considering their smart home market entry strategies.
