The Nature Uganda organized tournament to be played on July 8th under the theme Save the last Crane.
Golfers are set to play the game they love most for yet another humanitarian and conservation cause when they compete in the first ever annual Crane Golf tournament aimed at raising funds to save the Grey crowned Crested Crane.The Nature Uganda organized tournament to be played on July 8th under the theme Save the last Crane. Plant the next Tree. is aimed at raising funds to save Ugandas national bird.The organisers decided to fundraise with golfers because of the golfers link with conservation with most of the golf courses/clubs boasting of lush green and cool environments dominated by trees which are a habitat to many bird species. We have a national and patriotic duty to save our national bird and government will work with all partners to ensure that we specifically halt the decline of Cranes but also ensure sustainable conservation of biodiversity richness in Uganda Dr. Abarirega Akankwasah, Acting Commissioner at the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities stated.Golf courses are roosting and feeding grounds for many species including the Cranes. At the same time golfers and the golf game are historically closely linked with conservation of birds including scoring of points in the game. For example a score will be called a birdie, an Eagle, an Albatross or a Condor, which are all names of birds. Therefore this tournament will not only strengthen golf game and conservation of nature but will provide golfers and general public through sport to contribute to saving our national bird that is now faced with extinction,.The population of the Cranes in Uganda was estimated at 100,000 in 1970s but today the number has reduced to 10,000.This has led to the Crane being listed as an endangered species by IUCN.This graceful bird is Ugandas national symbol; it is on our court of arms. It is also embroiled in every culture in Uganda, we must jealously protect it, Achilles Byaruhanga, Executive Director Nature Uganda said.
