Man admits making Belfast bomb hoax warnings
Police
13:11
Tuesday 03 May 2016
A man has pleaded guilty to carrying out a campaign of hoax bomb warnings in a Belfast neighbourhood where he lived.
Karl Patrick McCartan (35) admitted making a series of 999 calls claiming devices had been left in the Markets district of the city.McCartan, of Stewart Street in the Markets, appeared at Belfast Crown Court for an arraignment hearing where he pleaded guilty to a total of 12 offences of communicating false information causing belief of an explosion.
The hoax bomb calls were made to 999 emergency operators over a 11 day period in October 2015.
However, McCartan pleaded not guilty to a charge of making a threat to kill four drug dealers.Prosecution lawyer Rosemary Walsh asked for a week to speak to those who instruct me and also to the police to consider these pleas.Barry Gibson, defending, said he would direct a psychiatrist be prepared for the court to ascertain why he did these actions.Judge Sandra Crawford ordered a pre-sentence report and said the case would be reviewed next week.
McCartan was released on continuing bail ahead of sentencing on the bomb hoax charges later this month.
