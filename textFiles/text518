ANDREW McCARTHY ASKS: WHERE WOULD TRUMP BE IF HE HAD RUN AS WHAT HE IS, THE AMNESTY CANDIDATE?
Mark
YEAH, I PRETTY MUCH START WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE THINGS ARE FAKES NOW:
There Have Been Over
May 3, 2016
PROTESTERS FOR TRUMP:
I think its going to get worse if he gets the nomination and is the front-runner. I think its going to escalate, Luis Serrano, an organizer with California Immigration Youth Justice Alliance, told the Los Angeles Times. Were going to keep showing up and standing against the actions and the hate Donald Trump is creating.
Even Americans who dont support Mr. Trump may hear this and wonder who is really creating hate. The spectacles are made-for-ratings cable TV fodder, and Mr. Trump knows it. Every protester who breaks the law or waves a Mexican flag as a political statement in favor of illegal immigration might as well be voting for Mr. Trump.
Theres a lot about Trump and his most fevered supporters to question (as we should everyone who seeks the oval office and his or her supporters), but watching a man trying to wade through a mob that pays lip service to tolerance and diversity, and yet is poised to rip him to shreds because hes wearing the wrong baseball cap, I know which side Im on.

Trump is irrelevant to the protests and protesters. They protest the leading Republican because protesting the leading Republican is what they do. The signs are already made, the sound bites are already written, all that is left is to insert the name of the leading Republican.

The increasingly fascist tendencies of the Left are the primary reason for Trump's rise. The more the Left descends into violence and hysteria over Trump, the more Americans are going to see what the Left is becoming, and will do what they can to stop it. And for now, they will decide that the best thing to do, is to do exactly what drives the fascistic Left crazy. That's how Trump beats Hillary.

Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.
I have personally seen several people openly declare support for Trump as a specific response to this violence.
Burn baby burn.

The liberals have created an historically massive humanitarian crisis through illegal immigration, and Trump is promising to clean it up.
I thank God that we finally have a politician who wants to do something about it.
Send these unfortunate people back to their countries to make their countries more like the US rather than make the US more like their miserable 3rd world nations.
I fully support multiculturalism.
Mexico is a great place for Mexican culture.
Honduras is a great place for Hondurans.
America is a great place for Americans.

Do these protesters realize they're actually helping Trump?Sometimes, the cynical side of me wonders if this isn't all some massive false flag operation

The Trump campaign is turning into some sort of Alinskyite kryptonite. The left has tried several tactics on him, and they're backfiring. Fascinating, and really, really fun to watch.

So, the media are planning to play both sides? Attack Trump for being so hateful that he prompts violent protests, AND imply that he's paying people to protest him as a PR gimmick?

I remember when the mild mannered, upright, decent, gracious Mitt Romney was accused of giving a woman cancer, hating women by putting them into binders, and sundry other horrifying acts.
