Shelter sales soar after early start to tornado season.

Rowlett residents sits on the lot where a tornado tore away his home.

You can figure out the ending to Michael Smith's story about what happened to his home on December 26 pretty quickly by looking at his house. It's now just a slab on Lindsey Drive in Rowlett.But it's what happened the morning, a conversation with his wife, that now almost seems eerie.
"[My wife] told me that when we dug our pool she wanted a storm shelter, and I told her that's really not necessary," he said.
That night, the tornado that tore through Rowlett ripped open the home the Smiths had lived in for only nine weeks.
"The first thing I said after we got out of the laundry room and I looked up and realized we had no ceiling left, or roof or anything like that, was 'You win,'" Smith said.
"It has really been hectic, starting December the 27," said Bill Stegman, CEO of American Tornado Masters based in Dallas-Fort Worth.
His desk in his Dallas office is filled with projects from his earliest busy season in years. He says they've sold at least 100 shelters as of today, at $7,900 and up. They usually don't sell that many until June. That also means if you order now, there's a wait.
"Our above ground units right now are running about four to six weeks behind," said Stegman.
Smith spent a little over $5,000 on a unit from Home Depot, and waited three weeks for delivery. It is the only thing on his lot that's standing.
"Hopefully we'll have a house before too long," he said.
And for others who may be debating the purchase, Smith is happy to share the story about how his wife was right.
