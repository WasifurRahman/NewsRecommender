It was Famous Dances Night Monday onDancing with the Stars, which meantour remaining celebs were doing routines inspired by movies, TV, and music that, chances are, you'veshookit to in the car, recreated in your living room, or sung into your home recording studio, akathe shower.After last week's Switch-up, the stars were once again paired with their original partners. An extremely confident Nyle DiMarco was looking to stay on top, andAntonio Brown put up a fight to get out of the bottom.Here are our picks for the top 5 dances of the night:1. WanyMorrisand Lindsay ArnoldBoyz II Men to 'NSYNC. This celeb was back on top this week, after having a slip up during the Switch-up.Wanyand Lindsay danced a jazz routine inspired by the boy band's performance from the MTV Video Music Awards back in 2000. The couple scored a 29and impressed band members Lance Bass and Joey Fatone who were in the house.2. Antonio Brown andSharna BurgessLast week, when Sharna was asked who she thought would win the competition, she didn't say her teammate,Antonio, which absolutely crushed him. In a heart-to-heart, Antonio shared his disappointment with Sharna, and she apologized for what she said. Then Antonio motivated the whole country with a pep talk about adversity.And after"workingso hard," the couple made a second half comeback with a jive toFootloose that earned them27 points from the judges.3. Paige VanZant and MarkBallasIs this night making you nostalgic, baby? Well hold on to your go-go boots. After Paige and Mark's original song was pulled for legal reasons (or Dr. Evil) they had to start learning a jazz routine to the Austin Powerstheme song, which put them two days behind schedule.Still, the two earned 28 points from the judges,which included a 10 from the birthday boy Len Goodman. Yeah, baby.4. Jodie Sweetin and Keo MotsepeJodie overcame an injury this week after Keo landed on her foot while prepping for theircontemporary number to Pink's Try. Luckily, the Fuller House actressdidn't break anything, andKeo changed the lift. This dance gave us the chills, and the judges gave the duo 25 points for it.5. Nyle DiMarco and Peta MurgatroydThere's absolutely nothing wrong with being Confident, as Demi Lovato can attest to. And, it pains us to say this, but Nyle got a bit too bigfor his yellow britches this week. Nyle said Val was his biggest competition, which rubbed Len the wrong way.Still, Nyle and Peta's quicksteptook us back to the Coco Bongo nightclub from The Mask,where we first sawCameron Diaz nearly 22 years ago. The judges gave the couple a 25 for their routine.Other things:CouplesKim Fields and Sasha Farber, Von Miller and Witney Carson, andGinger Zee andValChmerkovskiy each earned 24 points for their routines.Though Doug Flutie enjoyed his Bollywood routine inspired bySlumdog Millionaire, he and Karina Smirnoff only walked away with 21 points from the judges.The EliminationDoug and Karina were eliminated from the competition, and ourconsolation is that Doug really seemed to have fun with his dance this week.Next Monday, there will be a double-elimination, and the men will face off against the women inteam dances.See how this battle of the sexes plays outwhenDWTSairs Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
