Several years ago I went to diversity training for a job. It was a load of crap and I refused to participate in the exercises. I got some pushback because I said it reminded me of the sociology courses at the University of California in the '70's. If more people would complain, loudly, it would go away. SJWs are cowards, after all.

Sounds like he's talking about the Republican party which is why Trump resonated, whether he meant it, however crudely he went about it, however limited it might be he pushed back, wasn't afraid to push back, enjoyed pushing back. That defiance changed the debate within the Republican party, Cruz and Rubio caught on and switched from open borders to tough on immigration. Trump showed the absurdly preposterously named "religion of peace" a description invented by George W. Bush, could ne talked a out honestly without the sky falling. It was refreshing to see a Republican stand up for something after eight years.

Cruz and Rubio were never for open borders. Trump is for unrestricted H2A and H1B visas for him and his buddies. He will mandate amnesty. Just watch.As for religion of peace, never was.

p dawg
I agree with the author, but the true hell is that standing up in the manner suggested can have consequences for your family, too. If we were all single with no kids, we could stand up and fight this crap. But when you have a family, losing your job, even if it's for fighting the good fight, puts that family at risk. I don't know what the solution is, but that's an aspect of the problem that wasn't addressed in the article.
