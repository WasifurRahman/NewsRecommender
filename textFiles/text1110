Pope Francis will receive 6,000 homeless pilgrims in Rome in November to celebrate the Jubilee of Mercy, one week before the close of the Holy Year.
ReutersPope Francis addresses crowds at a mass for the Youth Jubilee in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 24, 2016.
"This pilgrimage and encounter with Pope Francis will give the most vulnerable in our society, who often experience marginalisation, the chance to discover that their place is in God's heart and at the centre of the Church," said the organisers of the event in a statement.

From 11-13 November 2016, homeless people and those involved in their day-to-day care will take part in the European Festival of Joy and Mercy, organised by the Fratello Association.
The Association was born out of a 2014 pilgrimage, where 150 homeless people from France journeyed and met Pope Francis briefly. It "organises and hosts events with and for people in situations of exclusion in partnership with associations assisting such people", according to its website.
The November event will be attended by Pope Francis, who will give Catechesis on November 11 and then close the three days with Mass on November 13. There will also be a prayer vigil held by the Archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin.

The three days will focus on three themes: "God, source of consolation", "God, source of forgiveness" and "God source of hope". There will be opportunity to hear from "major witnesses", to be taken on tours around Rome and to meet Pope Francis.
The Jubilee Year of Mercy began on December 8, 2015 and is due to end on November 20 this year.
