Do Catholics Have a Personal Relationship With Jesus? How a Bob Jones Grad Came to Love the RosaryMay 3, 2012 by Fr. Dwight Longenecker Leave a CommentBeing brought up in a fundamentalist home, our family were not exactly anti-Catholic but we assumed that Catholics needed to get saved.Certainly I had never seen a set of rosary beads, and didnt know what they were for. I had never been into a Catholic church, but was told by my pastors that Catholics prayed to Mary and that had to be wrong because you were only supposed to worship one God and how could Mary be God? She was just an ordinary woman. We were therefore suspicious of anything to do with Mary.She didnt even make it on to our Christmas cards. We sent each other cards with photographs of open Bibles and poinsettias.It wasnt until I was an Anglican priest, living in England, many years later that someone from the parish returned from a pilgrimage to Walsingham and gave me a rosary. Here, Dwight. Try these. It might help. Thats when it all started. Read more.UPDATE: Check out my book: Praying the Rosary for Inner Healing. Go here for archived apologetics articles on the Blessed Virgin Mary.Filed Under: Uncategorized Leave a CommentLike Patheos Catholic on Facebook!CLICK HERE TO "LIKE" PATHEOS CATHOLIC ON FACEBOOK
