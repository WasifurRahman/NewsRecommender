Teenager glassed in vicious attack while waiting for taxi home
1:30pm Sunday 1st May 2016 in
By Amber Hicks, Reporter
A TEENAGER has been attacked and bottled in the back of the head by a group of men outside a Swindon pub.
The incident happened while the 19-year-old man was waiting to get a taxi home when the fracas broke out in the car park behind the Mail Coach Inn.
He was taken to Great Western Hospital and also suffered an injury above his eye, police have said.
The father of the boy is now making a desperate appeal online for any witnesses who saw the attack at 1.25am on Saturday to contact the police. The post on Facebook has had nearly 400 shares.
He said: He was bottled to the back of the head and kicked in the face by a gang of men when trying to go home in a taxi outside the Sir Daniel Arms.
My boy was lucky he can look after himself and that the police were present when this happened. He said the four or five guys that attacked him were probably in their 30s and of Eastern European background.
He was being kept in overnight in hospital as a precaution. He was lucky the police were literally there when it happened and saw that this was unprovoked attack at the back of the Mail Coach."
He added: Thank you for all the support and sharing the status, myself and my boy are very humbled by the support. I got to see him today and thankfully his jaw is not broken and his cuts will heal.
However I do want these people to face justice so that this doesn't happen again.
Police couldnt confirm if anyone had been arrested or questioned and said investigations into the assault were continuing.
Anyone with information can call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
