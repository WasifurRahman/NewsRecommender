Olivia Wilde in Michael Kors at the Met Gala: cute, but does it fit the theme?

Olivia Wilde and Emily Blunt, both very pregnant, wore formfitting Michael Kors at the Met Gala last night. I think Olivia is nailing the Manus x Machina theme just a little more with that fabulous silver choker and coordinating high pony. I love the how the grommets on Olivias strapless gown get more condensed into a tighter pattern along the bottom of the skirt. Thats an excellent detail. Her metallic makeup fits perfectly without being overdone. Emilys cobalt blue gown isnt as much of a standout but she looks great too. Unfortunately I feel like Ive seen this dress several times before because Kors likes to repeat this style.
Zendaya killed it in this copper one-shoulder Kors with a slight fishtail. I think the collar really makes this dress a standout. Only Zendaya could rock a bowl cut and make it look current, shes such a chameleon. Im not sure about the smokey eye but I see what her makeup artist was going for.
Lily Aldridge brought the gold from her dress up to her brows in this sequin cutout Michael Kors. Her body looks crazy in this and her face does too a bit, but if theres ever a time to be experimental with makeup, this is it. I love how the dress shimmers and how her makeup artist tried to replicate that with dewy skin and underdone eyes except for her brows. Theres something so clever in the way she was put together.

I know it wasnt hot in NYC yesterday so why was everyone so sweaty looking?

JIB, I know, right? Humidity? Or were makeup artists all going for a sexy sheen but got sweatbombs instead?

All the lights? Heavy dresses in uncomfortable fabrics?

With all that contouring/highlighting and tight pony, Olivia Wilde looks like a robot version of Amber Valletta here. Good for the theme, I guess? The dress is quite cool.

Yeah, thats what I first thought when I saw the thumbnail. Lily Aldrige and Zendaya look great.

Watching her on television last night, the makeup did look really bad.

She should never, ever wear that make up again.
Its awful on her. Makes her look very harsh.

Agreed about the horrible make-up on Olivia Wilde. It also enhances that slightly pushed-in, vintage Barbie-doll quality her face has.

Zendaya is just perfect.
The bowl cut is my favorite and it looks great on her. When I saw her styled like that I couldnt believe it.

I agree. She should have had her own post because she was absolutely stunning. It was silver dress after silver dress and she was a standout in a flattering color and killer dress.

I guess Im alone on this, but I dont care for Zendayas bowl cut at all. Shes so beautiful and I feel its too heavy for her face, and that eye makeup really didnt help either. Plus its a bowl cut, is that ever really flattering? Yeah she pulls it off better than most, but for me it was a miss.

You are not alone, she is a very beautiful young woman but that Dumb and Dumber hairstyle is horrible. Nobody, not even her, could save that. Also, her makeup is way to heavy, IMO. The dress is ok but the colour is unflattering to her skin, so overall I am not feeling the love for this look.
I love Emily and her comfortable, elegant blue dress. Olivias try hard everything
the overly smoky eye, the really low side cut on the dress, the ponytail so tight it gives me a headache just looking at it
nope.
If Lilys dress would have actually been tailored right it might have been great. She is already so slim
they couldnt afford another two inches of fabric so her breasts dont look like they are gasping for air? I am not sure about the whole gold eyebrow thing. I like the idea, but her natural eyebrow line peeking up above and under the gold one is distracting. Was it intended like that? Or the makeup artists didnt do a good enough job of coverage before applying the gold?

I loved Zendayas dress but hate her haircut. Olivia looks really good. Shes one of few people who didnt go metallic and still fit the theme.

I love Lilys dress but it looks very runway and would have looked so much better with a few small real-life modifications. She could have done with more fabric on top definitely. But her body is ridiculous so it still looked good, Im just nitpicking a bit.

Everyone looks like theyve arrived at the Capitol for the Hunger Games. I just dont find any of the crazy make up pretty or neat. It makes most of them look sweaty or greasy and old!

Zendaya looks like a high-fashion Ann Widdecombe here, and for that reason I cant stop giggling.

Zendaya looks fabulous. I know she wants to protect her hair from damage, but she manages to pick the ugliest wigs. A bowl cut!?

I think everyone looks pretty except for some of the makeup. I get it, theme, but it didnt photograph well.
