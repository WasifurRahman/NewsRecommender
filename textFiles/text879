We're a month into the baseball season and it sure went by quickly. A lot of important games have been played, and we've seen some head-turning performances.
This includes several ball clubs who struggled last season, but have surprised us thus far this spring with their outstanding showings on the diamond.

Check out the slideshow above to read up one 12 ball clubs who have battled back this season and enjoyed solid first months of ball. This includes Newark Tech, which posted an 11-2 mark in April.
