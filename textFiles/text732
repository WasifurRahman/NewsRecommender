Curve paused
Posted on 3rd May 2016 by lookwestlondon
Galliard Homes plans for the Chiswick Roundabout site are paused for a Hounslow Council review.
The plans for The Curve, submitted earlier in 2016, for a 320 home, 32 storey, twin tower development on the Chiswick Roundabout site, have met some local opposition.
Now Hounslow Council has announced a review, which will pause the process of deciding the application.
The review of the Local Plan, which will look at the impact of potential developments in the area of the Galliard development in the first instance, has no fixed timetable, so there is no new date for a decision.
The two towers
the lower one would be 25 storeys
would be on the triangular site formerly the subject of plans to build The Octopus, which was a proposal for a commercial building clad in advertising hoardings. The Galliard proposals retain some advertising boards on the exterior.
