Canadas WestJet Airlines Ltd reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower fuel costs.
Calgary-based WestJets fuel expenses, typically an airlines largest variable cost, fell nearly 21 per cent to $166.4 million.
WestJet shifted its focus to eastern Canada and suspended nearly a dozen daily flights in January from Albertas airports after airlines operating in the oil-rich province started recording a significant decline in passenger traffic.
