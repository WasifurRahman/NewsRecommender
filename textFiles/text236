Nurego Unleashes Industrial IOT APP Monetization

Nurego Unleashes Industrial IOT APP Monetization
Tweet
SEATTLE, May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Nurego BizOps solution untangles the complex and ever-changing environment of subscription based Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), aiming to reduce operational inefficiencies related to product launch and order-to-cash processes. Business model agility, processes automation, and performance insights assist CSPs to engage customers and expedite profitability in a challenging digital transformation era. Nurego's Digital BizOps solution is an integral part of GE Predix[TM], the cloud platform for the Industrial Internet.
Nurego's iterative build-measure-learn-adapt approach, on every key component of the business model - product portfolio, features, packaging, pricing, legal terms, customer segments and distribution channels - helps Industrial IOT Cloud Service Providers control and manage the financial risk of innovation.
The BizOps solution streamlines and automates the CSP's customer journey, promoting faster time-to-revenue, higher engagement and clearer visibility over acquisition and retention costs. From controlled product launch and offerings customization, through subscription, provisioning and entitlement management, to integration with billing systems, Nurego BizOps alleviates the stress of the rapidly changing landscape, without the need for development intervention.
In-depth visibility into key commercial and operational metrics, costs and revenues of every subscriber, IoT asset, package and product, makes it easy to continuously fine tune business models, control customer related expenses and nurture long-term and profitable customer relationships.
"Traditional business process management solutions are inadequate for managing today's fast changing environments due to the lack of agility, visibility and real-time decision-making capabilities," adds Ervin Leibovici, CEO of Nurego. "Nurego offers a flexible combination of ongoing modeling, automation, execution, measurement and optimization of business activity. It is the only way to react to customer shifts and competitive threats on time and stay relevant."
"In building Predix, GE's platform for the Industrial Internet, GE teamed up with Nurego to deliver Business Operations services for the services deployed on Predix" said Gytis Barzdukas, Head of Product Management, Predix. "Nurego enables business model innovation that complements the advanced Platform-as-a-Service capabilities in Predix. The result is a complete solution that empowers innovative software developers to deliver the highest value to their Industrial IoT customers."
Nurego has been recently recognized as one of the "Top 10 IoT Solution Providers 2016" by IT Infraworld (IoT Edition).
