Merrill Howard
Iowa Court of Appeals to hear 3 Scott County cases

Merrill Howard
The Iowa Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments Wednesday in three local cases, including a 2002 murder case and a nuisance lawsuit filed against the city of Davenport for sewer backup problems.Three panels each made up of three judges will hear cases beginning at 1 p.m. at the Scott County Courthouse, 400 W. 4th St., Davenport. Hearings are open to the public.Judges will first hear an appeal by Merrill Lee Howard, 30, who was among several people convicted in the shooting death of Deanna Shipp, 9, who was in Davenport for a family wedding and was hit by one of at least 12 bullets fired from two cars as she sat on the hood of a car at a nighttime party behind 1502 N. Harrison St.
Howard, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was sentenced in December 2002 to 50 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. He was ordered to serve 85 percent 42.5 years of the sentence.The sentence was later thrown out after state and federal rulings held that mandatory minimum sentences for juveniles are unconstitutional. He was resentenced in September 2014 to 50 years with the possibility of parole after serving 25 years.On appeal, Howard argues that the Iowa Constitution categorically bans the imposition of any minimum term of incarceration upon a juvenile and that the sentencing judge failed to properly apply the law concerning juvenile offenders.
The appeals court also will hear arguments related to a nuisance suit against the city of Davenport from backups of the sewer system in 2013. The nuisance claim was dismissed upon the city's motion for partial summary judgment.The trial on a negligence action in 2015 resulted in a verdict for the city. On appeal, the plaintiffs contend the court erred in dismissing their nuisance claim, relying in part upon Iowa code.
The final case involves an appeal of child custody, visitation child and spousal support and property distribution provisions of a divorce decree. The petitioner also objects to the courts award of trial attorney fees.The Iowa Court of Appeals reviews appeals from trial court decisions that the Supreme Court has transferred. A decision by the court is final unless the Iowa Supreme Court grants further review.The court decides cases with randomly selected panels that change in composition every three months.

Note that he is NOT saying he didn't do it. He's also not saying he wouldn't do it again if released.
He is right where he belongs, for a long time!
