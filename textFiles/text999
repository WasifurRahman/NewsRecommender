Police hunt man who stole bank card from lone teenager
Updated 10:19am Tuesday 3rd May 2016 in
POLICE have released an e-fit pictureof a man they are hunting after a woman had her bank card stolen from her handbag in Royal Wootton Bassett.
The incident happened at around 5pm on Sunday, April 24, when the man approached a 19-year-old woman who was walking in Richards Close.
He took a bank card from her handbag before running off alongside the play park on New Road, using the path which leads to Beamans Lane.
The suspect is described as a white male, aged in his 20s or 30s, about 5 ft 9 inches tall and of slim build.
He had a pale complexion, a blondbeard and blondhair. He wore a black hooded top and grey jogging bottoms.
PC Kevin Payne said: This individual targeted a lone female in an isolated alleyway and caused her so much intimidation when he approached her that she feared for her safety.
"Thankfully she is ok, however, this incident has left her very upset and shaken.
"We have released the e-fit as part of a renewed appeal to encourage witnesses, or anyone with any information which may help us with our investigation to come forward."
Anyone with any information is urged to contact PC Payne at Gablecross Police Station via 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
