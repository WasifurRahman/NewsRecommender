Back to Gallery
Blac Chyna has been helping her fianc Rob Kardashian shed the pounds, but shes about to ratchet up his weight loss regimen to the next level!
Blac wants Rob thinner in time for their wedding so shes booking him into a fat camp to get things kick-started, a source exclusively told RadarOnline.com.
Chyna, 27, may have better luck making her man go to fat camp than did his mom, Kris Jenner.

Its ironic because this is something Kris tried to do, but he never showed up, revealed the source.
Blac is a whole other story though and hes totally whipped, so expect to see a dramatic transformation of Robs waistline over the next months.
As Radar reported, Kardashian recently took to social media to reveal his current weight
just under 250 pounds
and his goal of losing 50 more pounds.

I think thats perfect, Chyna told Kardashian, insisting she was also going to train with him every day for the next five weeks.
Despite appearances, Chynas desire for her 29-year-old future husband to get to a healthier weight isnt totally a selfless move, said the source.
Blac wants them both to look their very best for the wedding
neither have been married before so shes putting a lot of pressure on him to make their big day literally picture perfect.
