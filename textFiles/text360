Bella & Gigi Hadid brought their boyfriends to the Met Gala: adorable?

Call me crazy, but I love that the Hadid sisters came to the Met Gala with their high-profile boyfriends.
And I love that the boyfriends played along!!!
Gigi Hadid came to the Met Gala with her boyfriend Zayn Malik, who decided to go with the theme and wear a tuxedo with robot arms.
Which is amazing.
Gigi wore a simple (albeit slightly boring) Tommy Hilfiger gown which has the benefit of being flattering and uncontroversial.
Besides, whos looking at her gown when her boyfriend has robot arms?!
I love that Zayn did that, and I love that he was her date, and I love looking at the two of them together.
They are SO CUTE.
Meanwhile, Gigis sister Bella Hadid came to the Met Gala with her official boyfriend The Weeknd.
Two years ago, I would not have thought that The Weeknd was the kind of dude who would agree to be a plus-one at the Met Gala, but I believe The Weeknd has made the choice to play the game.
And its a good thing
he takes these events seriously, and he comes across as professional-and-fun.
Bella wore this Givenchy ensemble which is too much.
I liked the top half (and this is the most beautiful Ive ever seen her look), but the bottom half is too much.

All I see with those black stocking things is support post surgery socks, or anti deep vein thrombosis ones, especially with the open toed shoe look
(I realise they are all one item and I just cannot with the open toed boot thing)

I have seen that exact same look from Gigi a thousand times, its soooooo boring. This couple and their constant PDA is actually starting to annoy me. Zany left right after the red carpet photos so I question why he was even there at all. I like Bellas look though.

I second this. I also feel like with every passing year, the Met Ball gets less interesting. The fashion is nothing memorable and its just become a parade of famous peoples kids. I just wasnt impressed with most of the attendees. This saddens me, I used to love this event.

Zayns suit is actually working for me. It goes with the theme.
The Weekends suit looks like he borrowed it from his Dadits in desperate need of tailoring.

I agree, both couples being there was quite cute. I love Bellas dress, and I think it needed to be extra, otherwise it would be just another black strapless dress with a high slit.
I saw some other pictures and I liked to see it moving.
I love Zayns robot arms too, so cool.

All I see when I look at Bella is Jennifer Lawrence with dark hair.
They all look great though.

Nooooo Bella is wearing those butt ugly shoe/ tight/ boot things that I hate
with the three toes sticking out. Ruins the whole look for me ugh.
Gigi looks extremely boring. Zayn is too fine. My goodness.

I just realized Gigis doing the whole granny panties with sheer overlay look I despise so much.
Previously, the only pics I saw of Zayn showed his left arm, so I thought he just had one robot arm.
I think I like the look of that better than two robot arms.

I know Zayn and Gigi look nice together, but I cant help feeling bad for Perrie.
Bella looks 35.
