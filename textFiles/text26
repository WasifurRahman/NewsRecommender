Rock 'n' Roll Looks Strut the Runway at WITC Fashion Show.

Rock 'n' roll came back to life during a sold-out fashion show in Superior Monday.
WITC cosmetology students styled 30 models in iconic hair design, make-up and clothing from the rock 'n roll age for "HairStory."
The students explored hair esthetics and nail technology, and they had a chance to showcase their creativity and skill set to the public and potential employers.
"We're very excited for the students to showcase their talents and our program in general. So we're excited to have every one here and show people what we do," said Jean Engebret, a cosmetology instructor at WITC.
All proceeds from "HairStory" will go benefit the school's cosmetology club and scholarship funds.
