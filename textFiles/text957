VIDEO: Cyclist Ricardo gets back in the saddle for 8 hour cycle
Updated 2:10pm Monday 2nd May 2016 in
By Eve Buckland
A CYCLIST who rode from Swindon to Barcelona has got back in the saddle for an eight hour ride, in the hopes of reaching a 10,000 target.
Bootcamp leader Ricardo DeFazio got back on his bike for a static cycle at Go Outdoors, Ocotal Way, days after returning from a 970 mile to the Spanish city.
On April 11, Ricardo joined by Pete Woolley, Louise Eggleton, Vanessa Ryman, Steve Duffy, Steve Summers and David Cunningham set off across Europe from the County Ground . They reached the home of FC Barcelona, Camp Nou, eight days later. The team are hoping the fundraiser will bring in 10,000 to be split equally between Prospect, Brighter Futures and Younite Outreach Project.
Ricardo said the team were safely on the road to 10,000.
We wanted to raise 10,000 so this is giving that extra little push to make sure that we can get there, every little bit helps as long as you are determined enough and believe that you can do it," he said.
Ricardo was joined for the session by inspirational cyclist Paul Pratt. Paul had a stroke 10 years ago and has since lost three stone as a result of cycling.
The 31-year-old fitness instructor, who is teaching a spin class after the mammoth cycle ride, remained positive about the all-day ride.
I get into my rhythm and then Im absolutely fine. The way I see it, I have just cycled to Barcelona so this is going to be a lot simpler compared to that, he said.
It motivates me having to fight to reach the target, I have to cycle into it, keep focused and keep the engine running, I have a lot to prove and Im not going to quit.
Browsing customers had the chance to donate into buckets or sample some sweet treats as they watched the determined cyclists.
The static bike ride follows a Bootcamp Ball held at the Moonrakers, which raised 987.
To help the team reach their 10,000 target, donations can be made at crowdfunding.justgiving.com/S2B4C
